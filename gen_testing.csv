"Abstract Purpose Novel terms describing several designs of resin-bonded fixed partial dentures (RBFPDs) continue to appear. Indeed, a variety of terms are used in the English scientific literature The use of a standard terminology is important for a fair and efficient understanding. This study aimed to investigate if the terminology used to describe designs and retention methods for anterior RBFPDs is standard. Methods An electronic search in the English literature was conducted in PubMed/Medline to identify all publications reporting RBFPDs in the anterior region until August 2022. This search was completed by hand searching. Terms indicating different designs of RBFPDs were listed and then classified. Percentages of their use were calculated to determine the commonly used terms. Analysis of the use of these terms was performed based on the standards determined by the latest edition of the Glossary of Prosthodontic Terms (GPT). The impacts of the MeSH Thesaurus and GPT on the nomenclature used for RBFPDs was assessed. Results A total of 125 articles were eligible for this review. In the retained articles, 86 terms were found. Among them, thirty-nine terms were classified into three groups. Only six terms were defined in the latest edition of GPT (GPT-9). Several classified terms that are commonly used were not identified in the GPT-9. Conversely to the GPT-9 which impact was insignificant, the MeSH Thesaurus had an important impact on the nomenclature used for RBFPDs. Conclusion The terminology used to describe designs and retention methods for anterior RBFPDs was non-standard. The GPT-9, constituting an important reference, defined a limited number of terms related to RBFPDs and had no significant impact on the standardization of the terminology used for RBFPDs. Efforts should therefore be continued to standardize the terminology. A specialized mini-glossary grouping and defining all the terms found in this study will helpful in clarifying the terminology used for the anterior RBFPDs.","This study investigated the standardization of terminology for anterior resin-bonded fixed partial dentures (RBFPDs) in English scientific literature. Analyzing 125 articles, it identified 86 terms, with only six defined in the Glossary of Prosthodontic Terms (GPT-9). The MeSH Thesaurus significantly influenced RBFPD nomenclature, unlike GPT-9. The findings highlight the non-standard use of terminology in this field, suggesting the creation of a specialized mini-glossary for clearer and more standardized terminology regarding anterior RBFPDs."
"Literacy in the 21st century is now no longer regarded simply as the ability to use a language competently in a mono-cultural setting (Cope & Kalantzis, 2009; New London Group, 1996). Literacy today involves students knowing how to navigate across an increasingly complex communication landscape and to negotiate a range of contexts and patterns of intercultural meanings as well as the prevalence of multimodal texts (Cope & Kalantzis, 2021).

Contemporary communication environment is characterised by multimodal meaning-making, that is the “multiplicities of media and modes”, as well as “increasing local diversity and global connectedness” (New London Group, 1996, p. 62) which necessitates a shift in the pedagogical approaches that are adopted by teachers (Morita-Mullaney, 2021). This is especially so in the digital age where a sole focus on language in literacy is no longer sufficient for the new workplace given that a revised sense of ‘competence’ is required (Palsa & Mertala, 2019; van Leeuwen, 2017). The recognition of social diversity also demands pedagogical approaches that engages with the transcultural (de Souza, 2017) and multicultural (Mizusawa & Kiss, 2020) classroom. Issues of the day such as fake news (Douka, Fterniati & Archakis, 2017; Weninger, 2019) and social justice concerns (Andrews, Prozesky & Fouché, 2020; de Souza, 2019) also need to be addressed in the literacy classroom.

Multimodality focuses on understanding how semiotic resources (visual, gestural, spatial, linguistic, and others) work and are organised. Multimodality in education adopts an expanded view of literacy to include the range of multimodal communicative practices which young people are involved in today's digital age. Multimodal pedagogies refer to the ways in which the teacher can design learning experiences using a range of multimodal resources (Bezemer & Kress, 2016). It involves teachers making design choices in the ways in which the curriculum content is expressed, arranged, and sequenced multimodally (Kress & Selander, 2012). Multimodal pedagogies also involve designing opportunities for students to explore and perform ideas and identities using a range of meaning-making resources (Lim, Towndrow & Tan, 2021). The teaching and learning activities often involve drawing from the students’ funds of knowledge and their lifeworld (New London Group, 1996). With multimodal pedagogies, teachers orchestrate the learning process by weaving together a series of knowledge representations into a cohesive tapestry and in so doing make apt selection of meaning-making resources to design the students’ learning experience.","21st-century literacy extends beyond language proficiency, encompassing the ability to navigate a complex, multimodal communication landscape. This requires pedagogical shifts to address digital media, social diversity, and issues like fake news and social justice. Multimodal pedagogies in education embrace diverse semiotic resources (visual, gestural, etc.) for teaching, focusing on designing learning experiences that integrate various communicative practices. Teachers are encouraged to use multimodal resources creatively, drawing on students' backgrounds and experiences, to effectively engage with contemporary communication challenges and diverse classroom environments."
"Introduction
“children get motivated depending on the teacher's strategies…no child can hate school because of the language of instruction”. (T9)

Multilingual medium-of-instruction (MOI) policies have been commonplace in global education systems. In many African countries, although there is a strong recognition of benefits associated with mother tongues, such as for providing education accessible for the majority (Brock-Utne, 2000) and for national development (Chumbow, 2005), in policy practice, the prominent model is often in favour of an ‘early-exit’ model, which calls for a transition to an international language due to its perceived instrumentality (Heugh, 2011). Concerning the implications of using international languages for instruction especially in resource-constrained environments, a number of authors have critiqued the appropriateness of such a model from the angle of social justice (Babaci-Wilhite, 2015; Phillipson, 1992; Trudell, 2010). Furthermore, without a thoughtfully planned transition that involves coherent support across the education system (Bowden & Barrett, 2022), teachers and students are required to communicate in an unfamiliar language while learning the subject content. This is likely to generate significant challenges with learning (Clegg & Simpson, 2016). Questions have been raised regarding the effectiveness of the ‘early-exit’ model in enabling sustained learning over the schooling cycles (Ball, 2011; Brock-Utne, 2012).

In recent years, the concern with sustained learning has led to more scholarly focus on language-supportive pedagogy. Language-supportive pedagogy recognises classroom strategies as a core factor to enable learning under the constraint of an unfamiliar MOI (Erling et al., 2021). Complementing prior studies in Tanzania (William & Ndabakurane, 2017) and Rwanda (Milligan et al., 2016) which have highlighted the positive impact of language-supportive textbooks on student learning experiences and outcomes, this study was designed to understand more broadly how teachers could support students through pedagogical practice. Following Bruner (1996) and Alexander (2001), we refer to pedagogy in this paper not only narrowly to any specific teaching and learning techniques, but the complex engagement of teachers with the wider debates such as the purpose of education, and how practice can meet students’ needs in line with contextual realities. The need for supporting students learning in an unfamiliar MOI is situated in these broader needs. In recognition of these multiple concerns regarding the MOI, this paper focuses on Rwanda as a case study where a few major shifts in language policies have taken place (see Samuelson & Freedman, 2010 for a more detailed discussion).

2. Conceptual framework
This research is conceptualised based on the changing educational policies in Rwanda. To achieve the policy visions envisaged, teachers are the key implementors. They are also relied on as innovators in the context, where changes can often take place abruptly or rapidly (Pearson, 2014).

The current Rwandan education policies are in line with Vision 2050, which sets out the country's development goals. One of its key pillars “human development” relies on availing “universal access to high quality education” for Rwandans (MINECOFIN, 2020). In the competence-based curriculum (CBC) which has been implemented since 2016, quality education is conceptualised through a range of outcomes beyond knowledge acquisition, and in particular, competencies and skills for the world of work (REB/MINEDUC, 2015, p.1). While teaching and learning generally relies on language for interaction, “communication in the official languages” is specifically listed as one of the basic competencies to be achieved (REB/MINEDUC, 2015, p.11). The curriculum further specifies that this requires students to have sufficient language skills for comprehension, and for the application of oral as well as written expressions appropriately across a range of socio-cultural contexts. Higher level skills such as being capable of analysis and interpretation are also mentioned (REB/MINEDUC, 2015, p.15). However, the curriculum document does not clearly stipulate how these envisioned competencies could be achieved and through which specific pedagogical strategies. While there is a list of officially recommended teaching-and-learning activities such as presentations and discussions (REB/MINEDUC, 2015, p.23), these all require students to be comfortable with the MOI. Yet, the challenges of using English as a MOI are consistently reported in Rwandan classrooms (Sibomana, 2014; C. Tabaro & Twahirwa, 2018), which is also a key barrier to effective CBC implementation (V. Nsengimana, 2021).

While the CBC stipulates the use of Kinyarwanda from lower primary levels, the most recent official communique dated on 2nd December 2019 stipulates the use of English from Primary 1 onwards (MINEDUC, 2019b). This decision is to align with “Government of Rwanda's vision to improve proficiency of all languages” which is desired for students to access wider opportunities both regionally and globally, thereby requiring schools to “put in place strategies to strengthen the teaching and learning of all languages” (MINEDUC, 2019b). These strategies were, however, similarly unspecified in the communique document. Under this backdrop, this paper aims to explore the strategies utilised by Rwandan teachers to support students learning through the MOI. This is important to achieve the policy visions desired by Vision 2050 in reality.","This paper explores the challenges and strategies in Rwandan education, focusing on multilingual medium-of-instruction (MOI) policies and language-supportive pedagogy. In Rwanda, the shift to English as the primary MOI poses difficulties, especially given the abrupt policy changes and lack of clear pedagogical guidance. Teachers play a crucial role in implementing these policies and innovating within this context. The study examines how teachers support students in learning through an unfamiliar MOI, aligning with Rwanda's Vision 2050 for high-quality, universally accessible education and competence-based curriculum goals."
"Problematizing the deficit views on teacher proficiency
While exploring teachers’ pedagogical strategies, this paper also commits to avoiding the teacher-deficit lens. As teacher proficiency in the MOI is often a concern (Simpson & Muvunyi, 2012), teachers in Rwanda have often been blamed for the low achievement of their pupils. Local studies have continually highlighted limited teacher proficiency and pedagogical skills in English as limitations in teaching (Niyibizi, 2015; Sibomana, 2014; Tabaro, 2012). Moreover, teachers’ language proficiency is often a common factor accounting for the prevalence of “teacher-led” approaches in African classrooms, a label associated with interactions that prioritize repetitions or recalling over higher level exploration (Hardman et al., 2008; Sibomana, 2020).

Although not denying the importance of language proficiency, adopting a deficit-driven lens risks overlooking multiple challenges faced by teachers in order to adapt to frequent policy changes. Tabaro and Twahirwa (2018) reported that teachers found challenging their limited exposure to English, the limited speaking and listening skills possessed by students, the teaching and learning materials, the irregular curriculum change, the insufficient teacher training, the short English lesson, and the lack of cooperation between teachers and educational leaders. Yet, once teachers have been provided with language supportive materials, a study in Rwanda revealed the potential that learning outcomes could be 16% higher than average (Milligan et al., 2016). Other strategies suggested to be effectively supporting teachers in various African contexts include easing the transition from early years, and using language-appropriate designs consistently across the education system ranging from pedagogy, textbooks, curriculum, assessment to the management of multilingual education (Clegg & Simpson, 2016).

Therefore, we argue that while it is important to acknowledge the enormous challenges encountered by teachers in enacting the language policy, it is also productive to go beyond this focus. There is a need to acknowledge teacher agency in innovating pedagogical practices with limited resources and support available. While attempting to overcome language barriers, teachers also simultaneously seek to address broader needs by enabling more diverse learners to have access to knowledge through using a wide range of pedagogical strategies. The need for examining these instances can provide examples on which to build, which enables sustainable changes that are responsive to contextual realities. Yet, as Sibomana (2016) highlighted, Rwandan teachers have generally been conceptualized as passive adopters of policies, and hence often unheard on how they handled emerging needs in the education system. Hence, this paper addressed the following research question: what strategies are used by primary school teachers in Rwanda to support students’ learning with English as the medium of instruction?","This paper challenges the deficit view of teacher proficiency in Rwanda, highlighting the complex challenges teachers face due to frequent policy changes and limited resources. While acknowledging the importance of language proficiency, it emphasizes teacher agency in innovating pedagogical practices under constraints. The study focuses on strategies used by primary school teachers to support student learning with English as the medium of instruction, moving beyond the perception of teachers as passive policy adopters. It aims to showcase sustainable, contextually responsive teaching methods that enable diverse learners to access knowledge."
"Limitations of the study
In terms of research collaboration, this project shows the potentials and opportunities for a constructive collaboration between team members based in the United Kingdom and Rwanda. We were aware of the highly problematic nature that occurs in the processes of knowledge production, during which the roles of African-based researchers often have been reduced to that of data collection (Voller et al., 2022). Hence throughout the project, from drafting the proposal, to the research design, analysis, and writing, we were committed to fostering a collaborative relationship among the teams led by both co-Principal Investigators in the project. However, the work was unfortunately disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This made regular communication often impossible due to limited internet bandwidth, among other personal circumstances. Moreover, both UK-based authors were unable to travel to Rwanda during the course of the project, while the Rwanda-based PI similarly had to delay his visit to the UK until almost the end of the planned timeline. Our fieldwork hence relied solely on the Rwandan team.

Secondly, in terms of methodology, although this study led to the identification of a range of pedagogical strategies reported by teachers in selected Rwandan primary schools, we acknowledge that this is a very small sample size. These findings thus are non-transferable to other schools in Rwanda, nor are they representative of the national realities. The convenience sampling we adopted due to COVID-19 restrictions also meant that we were unable to focus on specific teacher attributes such as gender for further analysis.

It is also a shortcoming that this project only collected perspectival data self-reported by teachers, and we were unable to use more methods for triangulation. Although classroom observations could have provided important insights to corroborate the teachers’ self-reported interview data, we decided not to include this method because it posed substantial health risk when social distancing could be difficult in crowded classrooms. Our study remains about teachers’ responses to pedagogical strategies when dealing with English as MOI. Future research will be required to visualise teachers’ reported strategies being enacted, such as their frequency, and the way that these strategies took place in teacher-student interactions within the classroom space. Most importantly, this can be followed by reflections with teachers to understand more fully their thinking processes.

This study, a collaborative effort between UK and Rwanda-based researchers, faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including disrupted communication and inability to travel, limiting fieldwork to the Rwandan team. Methodologically, it used a small, non-representative sample of Rwandan primary school teachers, with data solely based on their self-reported strategies for teaching English as a medium of instruction. Lack of classroom observations for data triangulation is a limitation. Future research is needed to observe and analyze these strategies in practice. The study was conceptualized, designed, and supervised collaboratively by the team."

Abstract
In South Africa, as in many parts of postcolonial Africa, English dominates the political economy and as a result is the medium of instruction chosen by the majority of South African schools, despite the fact that most learners do not have the opportunity to acquire English to the levels necessary for effective engagement with the curriculum. Where teachers and learners share a common home language, there is frequently a gap between language policy and practice, and codeswitching by teachers and learners is a common strategy to achieve a range of social and pedagogical goals. However, in teachers’ training the multilingual realities of the classroom have most often been framed in terms of a linguistic problem, with a deficit view of codeswitching. As a result, the potential to use two languages in the classroom in a structured and systematic way to support learning has not been generally recognised or developed. In addition, codeswitching practices are often covert with teachers ‘smuggling the vernacular into the classroom’ and adopting very different linguistic practices when observed, with serious implications for classroom-based research. This paper explores the conflicts and tensions in classroom codeswitching in the context of macrolevel contestations around language status and rights.","This paper examines the use of codeswitching in South African schools, where English is the dominant medium of instruction despite many learners lacking proficiency in it. Teachers and learners often codeswitch between English and their home language to bridge language gaps and achieve educational goals. However, teacher training typically views codeswitching negatively, overlooking its potential as a systematic educational tool. "
"Abstract
A multitude of clinical trials measuring hemodynamic and psychological parameters have shown the beneficial effects of music on health. However, there are no clear instructions on how to utilize the potential benefits of music to improve health outcomes. Moreover, whether the effect of music is transient or enduring has yet to be determined. To address the effect of music on vital parameters and emotional well-being of patients we provide an overview of methods and findings of some studies that have evaluated the physiological or psychological impacts of music. This review puts forward a proposed model for fostering an individualized approach that can examine the therapeutic effects of music.

•
Raising awareness about the potential health benefits of music can lead to further studies and establishing guidelines to employ music in health setting.



The History of Music and Medicine
Music has been an integral part of human life since the ancient past. As a powerful tool to express emotions, music has been used in the daily life of human beings for relaxation, stress reduction, dance, socialization, entertainment, ritual, and religious ceremonies.1

Music's effects on human health have been appealing yet controversial. The connection between music and medicine has been explored in the modern era. The combination of art and science recognizes the interconnected nature of these disciplines aiming to work synergistically.2

The relationship between music and physiological and psychological function was evaluated in several studies, and these studies have shown the potential but inconsistent benefits of music to improve health outcomes in various patient populations. Conclusive data are lacking, in part due to the challenges related to the subjective nature of musical preferences and the design of trials. A renewed interest in the application of music in health and raising awareness about the potential health benefits of music as a safe and non-pharmacological tool can lead to further recognition and can establish the value of music in improving health outcomes.3

Celebrities as Advocates for Health Initiatives
Medical conditions of famous individuals have resulted in greater awareness about their specific conditions. Basketball superstar, Magic Johnson publicly announced that he was affected with the human immune deficiency virus, which helped raise awareness about the condition and millions of dollars for research and therapy.4

The famous actress and human rights activist, Angelina Jolie revealed that she had undergone bilateral mastectomy after she was found to have a mutation in the BRCA1 gene. Her experience helped raise awareness about the importance of genetic testing for those who are at risk.5 The pop star Selena Gomez publicly spoke about her diagnosis of lupus, resulting in greater awareness about how this condition can affect the body, including how it can affect the kidneys and lead to kidney failure and the need for kidney transplantation.6

Stevie Wonder,7 Michael Jackson,8 and Elvis Presley9 were among other famous musicians who were known to struggle with medical conditions, resulting in raising awareness about specific disorders.

Toni Braxton shared her lupus journey with a team of kidney health experts and discussed lupus, kidney health, and the importance of routine testing. She is encouraging individuals with lupus nephritis to keep up with their health checks via the “Get Uncomfortable” campaign.10

Inspired celebrities, especially those who are involved in the music industry, can play a crucial role in raising awareness, injecting enthusiasm, and increasing funding to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of music. By producing solid evidence, specific guidelines can be established to apply music in health settings.

The Louis Armstrong Department of Music Therapy (musicandmedicine.org) was originally established and funded by the Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation, Inc through Mount Sinai in 1994. It applies music to improve physical symptoms and assesses the patient's unique mind-body connection, with licensed music therapists using current techniques in music psychotherapy and the management of pain and stress","

"Abstract
This article proposes a theoretical paradigm encapsulating the interrelations of music arousal and emotional valence with four commonly-studied musical factors: tempo, preference, familiarity, and presence of lyrics. We first posit music valence-arousal classifications and descriptors in accordance with the Circumplex model and a combination of several existing arousal theories. The subsequent section encompasses concise literature reviews on each of the four musical factors based on their interrelations with arousal, valence, individual difference, music-listening and engagement-related factors, while proposing delineations on their methodological considerations and classifications. Finally, a novel theoretical paradigm of interrelations among the pertaining musical factors, arousal theories, and potential differential effects among extroversion and neuroticism traits is constructed with several gap identifications following. Nevertheless, we emphasise the need in accounting for the intricate interrelations among musical factors in order to avoid confoundments in future music intervention research, while remaining open to further refinements of the proposed framework.

Introduction
The field of music psychology has focused on empirical research in examining the differential effects of a wide variety of musical factors through cognitive and affective sciences since the mid-20th century (Neumeyer, 2014; Thompson, 2014). Alongside extensive emphases on neuroscientific affective mechanisms of music, the study of human psychophysiology remains challenging as all human cognitive processes differ vastly in terms of musical perceptions and preferences; hence, to strengthen theoretical validity, it is essential to study listeners’ engagement and interactions with the musical context (Cassidy & MacDonald, 2007; Furnham & Bradley, 1997; Peretz & Zatorre, 2003; Perlovsky et al., 2011; Thaut & Hodges, 2018). Notably, Juslin and Västfjäll (2008) highlighted the general lack of regard music emotion studies have for psychophysiological factors in emotional induction, and presented six integral underlying mechanisms that determine emotional responses to music. They also emphasised the need to consider the interactions between such mechanisms and other musical factors, which would yield aligning or counteracting effects if overlooked. In addition, despite the expanding body of music psychology research, there remains a lack of agreement regarding the classifications of diverse musical factors and their respective interrelations.","This article introduces a theoretical framework linking musical factors like tempo, preference, familiarity, and lyrics to music arousal and emotional valence, based on the Circumplex model and arousal theories. It reviews literature on these factors' relationships with arousal, valence, and listener traits, highlighting methodological considerations. The framework aims to clarify interrelations and potential impacts on traits like extroversion and neuroticism, identifying gaps for future research and emphasizing the importance of accounting for complex interrelations in music intervention studies."
"Music tempo
Tempo is one of the most commonly utilised musical characteristics in music psychology research. Conventionally gauged by number of beats per minute (BPM), most studies commonly employ music tempo manipulations, as tempo is regarded as a ‘fundamental music descriptor’ (Arboleda et al., 2022, p. 299) with notable examples discussed in Schellenberg and Weiss (2013). Arboleda et al. (2022) suggested using classifications of faster-tempo and slower-tempo music to avoid confusion with rhythmic pace, 

Theoretical paradigm of interrelations among musical factors and further directions
Based on the musical factors discussed above, we propose a theoretical paradigm (Fig. 4) of music arousal and emotional valence interrelations with the four primary musical factors (tempo, preference, familiarity, presence of lyrics), individual difference factors (extroversion, neuroticism), and alignments with Hebb's OAT and Berlyne's Theory. The related works which led to each interrelation item are presented in Table 3. Conclusions were obtained from relevant theories, empirical

Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a delineation of music arousal and emotional valence, and constructed a novel theoretical paradigm on the interrelations of music arousal and emotional valence with tempo, preference (and pleasurability), familiarity, and presence of lyrics, while also considering the significant associations with arousal theories (Hebb's OAT and Berlyne's Theory) and personality traits of extroversion and neuroticism. ","This paper explores the relationship between music arousal, emotional valence, and musical factors such as tempo, preference, familiarity, and lyrics. It introduces a new theoretical paradigm linking these elements with arousal theories (Hebb's OAT and Berlyne's Theory) and personality traits like extroversion and neuroticism.

"Abstract
Forty subjects, 10 male musicians, 10 female musicians, 10 male non-musicians and 10 female non-musicians, were presented with 2 min tape recorded segments of linguistic, atonal and musical stimuli. Bilateral EEG recordings were made and alpha asymmetry was computed for each type of stimulus for each subject. Musicians and non-musicians differed significantly (P < 0·005) only for the musical stimuli. Right hemispheric activation accompanied music among non-musicians but was absent for musicians. These data suggest that hemispheric specialization is related to perceptual processing and experience and not merely to the acoustic properties of stimuli. Additionally, no sex differences were observed.

Résumé
On a présenté à 40 sujets (10 musiciens, 10 musiciennes, 10 non musiciens et 10 non musiciennes) des enregistrements sur bandes magnétiques de segments de 2 minutes de stimulus linguistiques, atonaux et musicaux. On a pratiqué des enregistrements E.E.G. bilatéraux et calculé l'asymétrie de l'alpha pour chaque type de stimulus et pour chaque sujet. La seule différence significative entre musiciens et non musiciens (p 0,005) était trouvée pour les stimulus musicaux. Une activation hémisphérique droite était présente lors des stimulus musicaux chez les non musiciens mais non chez les musiciens. Ces données suggèrent que la spécialisation hémisphérique est en relation avec le traitement et l'expérience perceptives et non simplement avec les propriétés acoustiques des stimulus. Aucune différence entre les sexes n'a été observée.

Zusammenfassung
40 Versuchspersonen wurden 2 Minuten dauernde Tonbandausschnitte vorgeführt, die sprachliche, atonale und musikalische Stimuli enthielten. Von diesen Versuchspersonen waren 10 männliche Musiker, 10 weibliche Musiker, 10 männliche Nicht-Musiker und 10 weibliche Nicht-Musiker. Es wurden bilaterale EEG-Ableitungen vorgenommen und die Alpha-Asymmetrie bei jeder Versuchsperson für jeden Typ vom Stimulus berechnet.

Die Musiker und die Nicht-Musiker unterschieden sich signifikant nur im Bezug auf die Musikstimulu. Bei Nicht-Musikern war Musik von einer rechts-hemisphärischen Aktivierung begleitet, während das bei Musikern nicht der Fall war. Diese Daten sprechen dafür, daβ eine spezielle Hemisphärentätigkeit der Verarbeitung des Wahrgenommenen und der Erfahrung des Betreffenden entspricht. Darüber hinaus wurden keine Unter-schiede hinsichtlich des Geschlechts beobachtet.","This study investigated how musicians and non-musicians' brains respond to different auditory stimuli.

EEG recordings showed significant differences only with musical stimuli, indicating right hemispheric activation in non-musicians but not in musicians.

"Key Points
The superficial amygdala is involved in the processing of basic socio-affective information, including music.

Music-evoked pleasure is associated with activity of the dopaminergic mesolimbic reward pathway (in particular the right nucleus accumbens and the left dorsal striatum) and with activity of the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex, pre-genual anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, anterior insula and mediodorsal thalamus. Thus, music-evoked pleasure is associated with the activation of a phylogenetically old reward network that functions to ensure the survival of the individual and the species.

Owing to its high structural and functional centrality, the amygdala is in a key position to modulate and regulate emotion networks with regard to initiating, maintaining and terminating emotions.

The concept of musical tension relates to emotions arising from processing intra-musical structure, including emotions associated with the build-up, fulfilment and violation of predictions.

Progressing tones and harmonies create an entropic flux that gives rise to a constantly changing (un)certainty of predictions and thus to musical tension.

Music triggers engagement in social functions, hence musical activity is directly related to the fulfilment of basic human needs, such as communication, cooperation and social attachment. Supporting social functions was probably an important adaptive function of music in the evolution of humans.

The hippocampus plays a part in the generation of attachment-related emotions and can be activated by music owing to music's ability to support social attachment.

The auditory cortex has emotion-specific functional connections with a broad range of limbic, paralimbic and neocortical structures. Thus, the role of the auditory cortex in emotion is more extensive than previously believed.

Music influences, and interacts with, the processing of visual information (whether visual information is real or imagined). Emotion-specific functional connections between auditory and visual cortices are part of an affective–attentional network that might have a role in visual alertness, visual imagery and an involuntary shift of attention.","

"Abstract
Functional specialization of the human auditory cortex in processing phonetic vs musical sounds was investigated. While subjects watched a silent self-selected movie, they were presented with sequences consisting of frequent and infrequent phonemes (/e/ and /o/, respectively) or chords (A major and A minor, respectively). The subjects' brain responses to these sounds were recorded with a 122-channel whole-head magnetometer. The data indicated that within the right hemisphere, the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) counterpart MMNm of the mismatch negativity (MMN) elicited by an infrequent chord change was stronger than the MMNm elicited by a phoneme change. Within the left hemisphere, the MMNm strength for a chord vs phoneme change did not significantly differ. Furthermore, the MMNm sources for the phoneme and chord changes were posterior to the P1m sources generated at or near the primary auditory areas. In addition, the MMNm source for a phoneme change was superior to that for the chord change in both hemispheres. The data thus provide evidence for spatially distinct cortical areas in both hemispheres specialized in representing phonetic and musical sounds. ","

"Introduction
Music-listening involves sensory processing of acoustic stimuli by the auditory system followed by cognitive and emotional processing in a neural network that is widely distributed in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, and rostral brainstem [Citation1–4]. Studies of regional cerebral blood flow [Citation5–7] and dopamine receptor-ligand binding [Citation7] in vivo have demonstrated activation of the reward system and limbic system during music listening. Music enhances motor performance during exercise in healthy adults [Citation8], and rehabilitation of motor and cognitive deficits in neurological patients [Citation9]. However, the biological background of these effects has largely been unknown.

From a genetic perspective, music is an epigenetic modulator that may affect human genes and their regulation. The regulatory roles of microRNAs are well studied in the development and synaptic plasticity of the human nervous system [Citation10,Citation11]. MicroRNAs are also involved in inner ear development and the sensory functions of the ear [Citation12]. Studies on zebra finches have indicated that song-listening regulates both novel and known microRNAs with implications on neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation [Citation13]. The song-listening response in zebra finches showed a positive correlation in transcriptomic changes of the auditory forebrain and the peripheral blood [Citation14]. We have previously shown that genes activated by music-listening and music-performance are involved in dopaminergic neurotransmission, long-term potentiation, synaptic plasticity, and memory [Citation15,Citation16]. Here, we analysed the effects of music-listening on the microRNA transcriptome using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics methods. We provide an integrated perspective of how music-listening affects miRNA levels by comparing the same cohort of human subjects as in the transcriptome study [Citation15], and published transcriptomic changes in songbirds including regulatory network and pathway analyses.   ","This study investigates the biological effects of music-listening, revealing its impact on the brain's auditory, reward, and limbic systems. Music's influence extends to motor performance in healthy adults and rehabilitation in neurological patients. Genetically, music acts as an epigenetic modulator, affecting microRNAs involved in nervous system development and synaptic plasticity. High-throughput sequencing of human subjects showed that music-listening alters microRNA levels, paralleling findings in songbirds, and is linked to dopaminergic neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and memory."
"Music can improve the efficiency of medical treatment when correctly associated with drug action, reducing risk factors involving deteriorating cardiac function. We evaluated the effect of musical auditory stimulus associated with anti-hypertensive medication on heart rate (HR) autonomic control in hypertensive subjects. We evaluated 37 well-controlled hypertensive patients designated for anti-hypertensive medication. Heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated from the HR monitor recordings of two different, randomly sorted protocols (control and music) on two separate days. Patients were examined in a resting condition 10 minutes before medication and 20 minutes, 40 minutes and 60 minutes after oral medication. Music was played throughout the 60 minutes after medication with the same intensity for all subjects in the music protocol. We noted analogous response of systolic and diastolic arterial pressure in both protocols. HR decreased 60 minutes after medication in the music protocol while it remained unchanged in the control protocol. The effects of anti-hypertensive medication on SDNN (Standard deviation of all normal RR intervals), LF (low frequency, nu), HF (high frequency, nu) and alpha-1 scale were more intense in the music protocol. In conclusion, musical auditory stimulus increased HR autonomic responses to anti-hypertensive medication in well-controlled hypertensive subjects. ","This study evaluated the effects of musical auditory stimulus combined with anti-hypertensive medication on heart rate (HR) autonomic control in 37 well-controlled hypertensive patients. Results showed that while systolic and diastolic blood pressure responses were similar in both music and control protocols, HR decreased significantly 60 minutes after medication when music was played. Music intensified the medication's effects on heart rate variability indicators, suggesting that musical stimulus enhances autonomic responses to anti-hypertensive treatment in hypertensive patients."
"Description:
For thousands of art lovers both amateur and professional, aesthetic life began with
Janson, as H.W. Janson's History of Art is often called. In the first edition, published in
1962, Janson spoke to that perennial reader he gently called ""the troubled layman.""
His opening paragraph revealed his sympathy: ""Why is this supposed to be art?"" he
quoted rhetorically. ""How often have we heard this question asked--or asked it
ourselves, perhaps--in front of one of the strange, disquieting works that we are likely
to find nowadays in the museum or art exhibition."" Keeping that curious, questioning
perspective in mind, he wrote a history of art from cave painting to Picasso that was
singularly welcoming, illuminating, and exciting.
After H.W. Janson died, in 1982, his son, Anthony F. Janson, took over the daunting
task of revising his father's book. Janson the elder would be thrilled with the beauty of
this fifth edition, which tips the scales at more than seven pounds. Thanks to advances
in printing, it teems with reproductions--736 in color and 500 black-and-white--that
would have been far too costly 35 years ago. At an even 1,000 pages, it is an inch
thicker than its 572-page progenitor.
Sojourning through this book, a reader is offered every amenity for a comfortable trip.
Because Janson never assumes knowledge on the part of the reader, a recent
immigrant from Mars could comprehend Western art from this text. The only
assumption the Jansons have made is that with a little guidance everyone can come to
understand the artifacts that centuries of architecture, sculpture, design, and painting
have deposited in our paths. Countless readers have proven the Jansons right--and
found their lives enriched in the process. --This text refers to an out of print or
unavailable edition of this title.
From Library Journal Horst W. Janson died in 1982, not long after the second edition
of his best-selling History of Art was published. His son Anthony (art history, Univ. of
North Carolina, Wilmington) inherited the franchise and has contributed to four
subsequent updates, this one appearing four years after the last revision. Familiar to
art history students throughout the world, this massive survey of 30,000 years of
Western art is generally regarded as the fundamental text for teaching the subject to
undergraduates. It is a deserving reputation, for in addition to the ecumenical
enthusiasm and economy of description infusing the Jansons' writing, the work
features time lines densely packed with data, four sections of over 100 primary
sources, well-chosen illustrations, and an updated bibliography including web
references. Its graphic design is rich with imagery and progresses without any
affectations. New to this edition are rewritten sections covering architecture, ancient
art, and French painting, as well as a discography of related recordings. A benchmark
text brought up-to-date, this is an essential purchase for libraries not already owning a
good copy of the fifth edition. Douglas F. Smith, Oakland P.L., CA.

"Abstract art, painting, sculpture, or graphic art in which the portrayal of things from the visible world plays little or no part. All art consists largely of elements that can be called abstract—elements of form, colour, line, tone, and texture. Prior to the 20th century these abstract elements were employed by artists to describe, illustrate, or reproduce the world of nature and of human civilization—and exposition dominated over expressive function.

Abstract art in its strictest sense has its origins in the 19th century. The period characterized by so vast a body of elaborately representational art produced for the sake of illustrating anecdote also produced a number of painters who examined the mechanism of light and visual perception. The period of Romanticism had put forward ideas about art that denied classicism’s emphasis on imitation and idealization and had instead stressed the role of imagination and of the unconscious as the essential creative factors. Gradually many painters of this period began to accept the new freedom and the new responsibilities implied in the coalescence of these attitudes. Maurice Denis’s statement of 1890, “It should be remembered that a picture—before being a war-horse, a nude, or an anecdote of some sort—is essentially a flat surface covered with colours assembled in a certain order,” summarizes the feeling among the Symbolist and Post-Impressionist artists of his time.

Western painting: The 20th century
All the major movements of the first two decades of the 20th century, including Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Futurism, in some way emphasized the gap between art and natural appearances.

There is, however, a deep distinction between abstracting from appearances, even if to the point of unrecognizability, and making works of art out of forms not drawn from the visible world. During the four or five years preceding World War I, such artists as Robert Delaunay, Wassily Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, and Vladimir Tatlin turned to fundamentally abstract art. (Kandinsky was traditionally regarded as having been the first modern artist to paint purely abstract pictures containing no recognizable objects, in 1910–11. That narrative, however, was later questioned, especially in the 21st century with the renewed interest in Swedish artist Hilma af Klint. She painted her first abstract work in 1906 but with a different goal than achieving pure abstraction.) The majority of even the progressive artists regarded the abandonment of every degree of representation with disfavour, however. During World War I the emergence of the de Stijl group in the Netherlands and of the Dada group in Zürich further widened the spectrum of abstract art.

Abstract art did not flourish between World Wars I and II. Beset by totalitarian politics and by art movements placing renewed emphasis on imagery, such as Surrealism and socially critical Realism, it received little notice. But after World War II an energetic American school of abstract painting called Abstract Expressionism emerged and had wide influence. Beginning in the 1950s abstract art was an accepted and widely practiced approach within European and American painting and sculpture. Abstract art puzzled and indeed confused many people, but for those who accepted its nonreferential language there is no doubt as to its value and achievements.","
Abstract art, diverging from traditional representation, focuses on elements like form, color, and texture. Originating in the 19th century, it evolved from Romanticism and Post-Impressionism, emphasizing imagination over imitation. Key movements like Fauvism, Cubism, and Expressionism further developed abstract art. Post-World War I, movements like de Stijl and Dada expanded its scope. Abstract Expressionism flourished post-World War II, especially in America, making abstract art a widely accepted and practiced form in modern art."
"What is abstract photography?
Abstract photography is when photographers absorb and replicate the aesthetic and techniques of the abstract art movement. These photographers use a combination of everyday objects, scenes and photographic techniques to create images consistent with other types of abstract art.

Photographers such as Barbara Crane, who died in 2019, used extreme close-ups, exaggerated shadow and overexposure to create an experimental aesthetic that distorted the traditional cityscape. In her Loop series, skyscrapers and apartment blocks were transformed into high-contrast geometric abstract images. “Though I build on past experience, I attempt to eradicate previous habits of seeing and thinking,” she said in 2002. “I keep searching for what is visually new to me, while always hoping that a fusion of form and content will take place.”

Like Crane, Kimberly Poppe also uses her camera to unlock new ways of seeing. Her landscapes are more evocative of Rothko's paintings than the ocean vistas they actually are, with the American abstract expressionist being one of her major influences. In Into The Blue, two bold yellow lines mark the horizon against a backdrop of multi-tonal blue and Remains of the Day also sees a calm, grey sea blend into the skyline. In The Bridge, that horizon is interrupted by distant and distorted neon lights. ","Abstract photography, inspired by the abstract art movement, uses everyday objects and scenes, employing techniques like close-ups, shadow play, and overexposure to create images with an experimental aesthetic. Artists like Barbara Crane transformed cityscapes into geometric abstracts, seeking visual novelty and a fusion of form and content. Kimberly Poppe's work, influenced by abstract expressionism, presents landscapes reminiscent of Rothko's paintings, blending colors and horizons to unlock new ways of seeing."
"A Brief History of Pointillism
Following the Impressionist period, a new movement came onto the scene - Pointillism! Also called Neo-Impressionism or Divisionism, it appeared in the 19th century thanks to the impetus of Georges Seurat and his contemporary, Paul Signac. Read on to discover the peculiarities of this movement and the great artists who embodied it.

By Cécile Martet
The birth of pointillism
It was in 1886 that the word ""pointillism"" first appeared in a note by the art critic Arsène Alexandre. Despite the fact that this was a new movement in the direct tradition of Impressionism, it was not a very glorious name!

It's almost with a certain disdain and undisguised condescension that art critics ridicule the works exploring this new pictorial research. So what does pointillism really consist of? Its name makes it easy to understand. For the artist, it's a matter of distinctly applying small dots of colour to form an image.

Petite histoire du Pointillisme
Georges Seurat, ""The River Seine at la Grande Jatte"". Spring (oil on canvas, 1888)
The pointillist movement was mainly driven by two painters: Georges-Pierre Seurat and Paul Signac. But along with them, other painters paved the way for a new vision of painting: Camille and Lucien Pissarro, Albert Dubois-Pillet, Henri Edmond-Cross, Théo Van Rysselberghe, Henri Matisse and even Van Gogh were inspired by them!

Petite histoire du Pointillisme
Camille Pissarro, “Picking peas” (1887)
An original technique derived from Impressionism
Pointillism, also known as Divisionism, is a highly accomplished pictorial technique. It trains the eye and the mind to blend and assimilate patches of colour into a wider chromatic range. It's a relatively original approach, since the succession of dabs of colour applied to the canvas allows us to see, from a distance, a true work of art being created. The artists associated with this artistic period, like those associated with Impressionism, depicted landscapes, portraits and seascapes: generally bucolic, soothing worlds that they painted directly in the open air.

Petite histoire du Pointillisme
Henri Edmond-Cross, “The lake in the Bois de Boulogne” (oil on canvas, 1899)
Instead of mixing colors on a palette, the pointillists apply their brush directly to the canvas with raw tones. They place small round or square touches on it: the mixing and blending of pigments occur directly on the canvas and not beforehand. This technique completely breaks away from traditional painting methods!

Petite histoire du Pointillisme
Albert Dubois-Pillet, “The banks of the Marne at dawn.” (1886)
The pointillist theory holds that one can only distinguish the dots from each other from a certain distance. The farther one gets from the work, the better one can consider it as a whole. The visual result obtained is quite different from that which arises from a prior mixing of colors on a palette.

Thanks to this use of colors, it sometimes happens that certain areas of the canvas that remain untouched become visible, which gives an even brighter effect to the work. The raw pigments thus retain their natural brilliance, and that's also why pointillism is so original: striking chiaroscuro and colorful contrasts that continue to amaze us!

Patience, patience... pointillism is a matter of patience.
Imagine yourself in front of an easel. Brushes in hand, paint tubes nearby, all that's left is to paint. But as a pointillist painter, you have quite the constraint! You'll have to progress dot by dot and without mixing. Yes, the task seems monumental. One might wonder why painters went through so much trouble. One of the reasons is simple: they wanted to revolutionize art and present a groundbreaking vision of painting.

Petite histoire du Pointillisme
Paul Signac, ""Woman Combing Her Hair."" Opus 227 (Arabesques for a Dressing Room, 1892 / Encaustic on Canvas Mounted on Panel, Musée d'Orsay Collection).
To achieve this, they relied on scientific theories of the time based on optical phenomena. One of them, Charles Henry, even wrote a book titled ""Color Circle"" which demonstrates how colors can be combined by placing them on a circle. The complementarity of colors arises from this.

A concept widely used today, as the search for harmony also involves the use of complementary hues, meaning colors that are opposite each other on the color circle. Blue with orange, red with green, yellow with violet.

These opposing pairs are ultimately associated and can be found in the works of the pointillists. Chromatic juxtapositions that create strong contrasts and even appear to intensify the individual colors. The colors vibrate with each other, in places where you wouldn't necessarily expect them. Touches of red in Paul Signac's sky, a violet sea – in short, the application is methodical. ","Pointillism, emerging in the 19th century and led by Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, involved applying small dots of color to form images. This technique, a derivation of Impressionism, allowed colors to blend at a distance, creating vibrant artworks. Pointillists didn't mix colors on a palette but directly on the canvas, offering striking contrasts and luminosity. The movement, requiring immense patience, revolutionized art with its scientific approach to color theory and chromatic juxtapositions."
"The 2020 Colours of the Year and how to use them in your art collection
The colour predictions for 2020 are all unanimous in their choice of calming tones of blues and greens inspired by nature, reflecting a need for a stable start to the decade in these turbulent times. We take a closer look at these colours and how you can incorporate them into your art collection.

By Rise Art
The colour predictions for 2020 are all unanimous in their choice of calming tones of blues and greens inspired by nature, reflecting a need for a stable start to the decade in these turbulent times. However, while Pantone has opted for an elegant blue suggestive of the sky at dusk, the dominant narrative in many other 2020 Colour Of The Year camps has been green. Whether dark or bright, neon or dusky, colour companies and trend forecasters from Dulux, Graham and Green and WGSN, selected the colour intuitively associated with regrowth and rebirth - green traditionally reassures us and speaks of optimism.

We take a closer look at these colours and how you can incorporate them into your art collection.

1) Classic Blue - Pantone

Pantone, the American behemoth of colour forecasting, opted for a surprisingly simple tone, that some may describe as an unusual and rather safe choice to follow the bright pastel hues of the preceding years. Timeless and enduring, Classic Blue brings a sense of peace and tranquility to the human spirit, offering refuge.

“Instilling calm, confidence, and connection, this enduring blue hue highlights our desire for a dependable and stable foundation on which to build as we cross the threshold into a new era.”

Since 2000, it has chosen a colour of the year decided from trend-forecasting research performed by the Pantone Color Institute. The annual colour, which is announced each December, is chosen based on ""what is taking place in our global culture at a moment in time"".

2) Tranquil Dawn - Dulux

Chosen to reflect our desire for calm, this new colour was created by Dulux’s team of colour experts, who discuss the new trends that affect us all, then translate these insights into a paint colour trend that can be used in a variety of interiors. This particular shade will help promote wellbeing and has the unique quality of subtly shifting its tone depending on the shades that it is combined with.

“As 2020 is the start of a new decade, it’s a fresh start. New dawn. In an increasingly hectic and digital world, there is a desire for meaning and kindness. So, inspired by the colours of the morning sky, our colour experts have created an inspiring new shade, Tranquil Dawn.”

3) Adeline- Graham & Brown

British wallpaper giants Graham & Green have selected a deep rich bottle green hue, Adeline, whose natural qualities work perfectly with most other colours. Their Colour Of The Year  has taken its name from the first name of the famous writer Virginia Woolf, who was a main figure within the Bloomsbury group that she started with her sister. The colour pinpoints the deepest leaf green in their Bloomsbury wallpaper and amplifies it, channelling the lively country gardens and whimsical interiors favoured by the Bloomsbury Group.

Described as an 'oxygenating, fresh tone', the statement hue 'balances the ever-increasing amount of technology making its way into the home, echoing a wider interiors trend which looks to biophilic design to inspire healthier, happier homes'.

3) Neo Mint - WGSN

Trend forecasting agency WGSN have championed Neo-Mint as their colour for 2020 and it evolves from the popularity of soft pastel shades, established by the world’s infatuation with Millennial Pink. 

This hue embodies a forward-thinking mood and an almost utopian optimism necessary for this era, as we look towards the future. Events slated to take place in 2020 – including the completion of the world's tallest building in Saudi Arabia; the start of NASA's Mars 2020 Rover mission; and the introduction of Uber's flying taxis – helped the team to pinpoint neo mint as an important colour for the dawn of the next decade.

According to the trend forecaster, neo mint is a gender-neutral colour with “an oxygenating, fresh tone that aligns science and technology with nature. What is becoming clear is the importance of neo mint – a shade that succinctly aligns futuristic development with nature.”","The 2020 Colours of the Year emphasize calming blues and greens inspired by nature, symbolizing stability amidst turbulent times. Pantone's Classic Blue offers tranquility and stability, while Dulux's Tranquil Dawn reflects a desire for calmness and wellbeing. Graham & Green's Adeline echoes the natural world and biophilic design, and WGSN's Neo Mint represents futuristic optimism and alignment with nature. These colors can be incorporated into art collections to evoke these themes and feelings."
"A Guide to Gifting Art This Christmas
Explore our guide to gifting art this Christmas and find art to suit every taste.

By Ruth Millington
Few gifts are more memorable and meaningful than a carefully chosen artwork. Especially as we are all spending much more time in our homes. But how do you decide what art to buy for your friend, family member or partner? It’s important to think about their ‘art personality’. What interests do they have? Is there a place they love? What’s their style? Consider, also, the character of their home. Here are seven ideas to help you give the perfect gift of art this Christmas.

 
1. FOR A LONDON LOVER
Mychael Barrat’s narrative paintings and prints are inspired by cityscapes, maps, fairy tales and literature. Many of his artworks also demonstrate his love of storytelling; as the artist has explained, “The visual artists that first inspired me were children’s book illustrators like Arthur Rackham and Edmund Dulac.” In intricate images he turns London into a magical kingdom, celebrating its history and heritage. ‘Made in London’ is filled with references to inspired by fairytales, literature and art history, providing hours of exploration for the viewer.

"Surrealist Artists to Know About
We’ve put together a guide to the surrealist movement and highlighted contemporary Surrealist artists finding beauty in the unconventional and meaning in the unexpected.

By Tatty Martin
What is Surrealism?
Surrealism is an exploration of the uncanny, the unconscious and the unseen. Since its conception in the early 20th century, surrealist artists, writers and thinkers have sought to question the way we think by dissecting our thoughts and presenting them back onto us. 

Although Surrealism started as a movement, it quickly established itself as an artistic style, in which artists inject the recognisable or the familiar with an element of the unexpected and otherworldly.

 



The False Mirror, 1929 by René Magritte. Image courtesy of MoMA.

 

History of Surrealism
The term Surrealism was first given to the movement by André Breton in his 1924 Surrealist Manifesto however, the term ‘surrealism’ had been coined by Guillaume Apollinaire twenty years earlier. A French word, with ‘sur’ translating to ‘beyond’ and ‘realisme’ meaning ‘realism’, surrealism was conceived to free the truths of the unconscious mind from the constraints of that considered 'real'.

Some surrealists took influence from Freud and the theories of psychoanalysis, others used automatic methods of expression to release repressed thoughts and unspoken tensions. The many different approaches and developments to the surrealist style demonstrates just how much influence it carried, and how its varying components, perspectives and techniques have seeped through art movements that have followed since. 

Among the most well known names in surrealist art are André Breton and Salvador Dalí. André Breton had previously been part of the Dada movement and founded the Surrealist movement ten years later, introducing ideas of automatism and intuitive art into the manifesto. Primarily a writer and a poet, Breton was also a practising artist and explored the chance association of text and image in his work.

Salvador Dalí is perhaps the most famous figure is the surrealist movement. Known both for his technical skills and his eccentric subject matter, many of Dalí’s works take their forms from dreams and memories. Motifs such as melting clocks, ants, drawers and baron lands are present throughout Dalí’s paintings, each symbolising an element of the artist’s innermost fears and fantasies. Although Dalí was expelled from the surrealist movement in 1934 because of his ‘counter-revolutionary’ behaviour, he still remains one of the most influential avant-garde artists.

Contemporary Surrealist Artists
Breton believed that surrealism has been present in the arts for centuries, claiming that writers Arthur Rimbaud and Jonathan Swift had also been working in a similar approach. Today, surrealist artists continue to work across painting, photography, sculpture, installation and beyond. From digital artist, Philip McKay who reimagines Dalí’s telephone in talk to me and references Magritte’s figures in about the weather, to Alexandra Gallagher’s hallucanagenic landscapes, surrealism straddles styles and mediums, existing as easily in abstract art, as in figurative sculpture.

Patrick Hughes
Patrick Hughes’ style covers elements of surrealism, pop art and realism. In his revespective paintings, Patrick employs a detailed and technical style to create optical illusions. Gallery scenes, street works and city sites become three dimensional, changing according to the viewer’s point of view. Patrick pioneered the reverspective approach in the 1960s, and he continues to create work that encourages the viewer to question our own understanding of perspective. 

 



Maeght by Patrick Hughes

 

Adrian Novac
Adrian Novac’s paintings have a dark, nocturnal quality to them. His portraits, still lives and abstract works blend the real with the imagined to make hallucinagenic impressions of the everyday. In some of his works, forms appear to be melting or dissolving, gradually loosing their solid form and joining their eerie and atmospheric surroundings. Adrian explores the darker avenues of the human psyche in these works, revealing the more haunting and uncanny side to surrealism. 

 



untitled by Adrian Novac

 

Dave Smith
Dave Smith’s style can be seen as both pop art and surrealist, or perhaps a combination of the two. Taking bright colours, cultural references and modern day phenomena from pop art, and a photorealist approach, complex composition and outlandish subject matter from surrealism, Dave’s work marries two seemingly disparate styles. Floating pizzas, giant shoes and upside down tents sits within scenic landscapes and spotless blue skies to give Dave’s work its dreamlike aesthetic. ","Surrealism, emerging in the early 20th century, is an artistic exploration of the uncanny and unconscious. Influenced by Freud and automatic expression methods, it has evolved from a movement to a distinct style, intertwining the familiar with the otherworldly. Key figures include André Breton and Salvador Dalí. Contemporary surrealists like Philip McKay, Patrick Hughes, Adrian Novac, and Dave Smith continue to challenge perspectives across various mediums, blending elements of realism, pop art, and the surreal to create dreamlike, hallucinogenic artworks."
"5 Things to know about Cubism
After the creation of the Demoiselles d'Avignon by Pablo Picasso, Cubism is characterised by its abandonment of classical perspective, fragmentation of forms and the independence of the foreground and background. The artist seeks to represent a three-dimensional object that can be observed from every angle on a two-dimensional surface.

By Cécile Martet
1. Cubism owes its origins to the work of Paul Cézanne...
In 1907, Picasso and Braque attended a retrospective of Paul Cézanne's work. His works opened up new perspectives for them, particularly in the treatment of space and form. Picasso paid close attention to a phrase written by Cézanne, in which the latter advocated ""treating nature with the cylinder, the sphere, the cone"".

2. …but also African Art
At the end of the 19th century, European artists were fascinated by the so-called ""primitive"" arts, which included African and Oceanic art. Henri Matisse in particular showed Pablo Picasso African masks, which fascinated the young painter and inspired him greatly during the creation of Cubism, particularly for the faces.

3. It was created by (just) two artists
Cubism is one of the few major artistic movements to have been conceptualised by just... two people: Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque. But it was not they who invented the name. History is reluctant to credit Henri Matisse or the art critic Louis Vauxcelles... One thing is certain: they did, however, initiate this veritable pictorial revolution. These two young painters, who were little known at the time, both experimented with the use of geometric shapes to represent reality. Sometimes it doesn't take many people to change history...

4. There are 3 types of Cubism
The movement developed between 1908 and 1916 in three phases. First came Cézanian cubism, then Analytical cubism, and finally Synthetic cubism. Each phase had its own characteristics and attempts!

5. Cubism also existed in sculpture... and even in literature!
Many artists, such as Lipchitz, Archipemko and Duchamp-Villon, followed the precepts and ideas of Cubism. They applied them to sculpture. The same decomposed, geometric forms can be found in sculpture as in painting","
Cubism, initiated by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, is known for abandoning classical perspective and fragmenting forms. Inspired by Paul Cézanne and African art, it represents three-dimensional objects on two-dimensional surfaces using geometric shapes. The movement, conceptualized by just Picasso and Braque, evolved through three phases: Cézanian, Analytical, and Synthetic Cubism. Cubism's influence extended beyond painting to sculpture and literature, with artists like Lipchitz and Duchamp-Villon adopting its principles in their works."
"Abstract Art: Examples Throughout History
Discover examples of Abstract Art throughout history, including works by the most famous artists of the 20th-century.

By Sophie Heatley
Abstract art, in practice, is the creation of artwork that does not explicitly represent reality but uses a multitude of shapes, colours, forms and marks to achieve an effect. The style evolved throughout the 1900s, giving way to sister movements such as Expressionism, Abstract Expressionism, Cubism, Orphism, Suprematism, Constructivism, Automatism, Colour-Field Painting, and more still. With its many modes and materials, the abstract system has yielded some of the world’s most-loved and memorable pieces of all time. Here are some examples.

 

Wassily Kandinsky, 1866-1944
An early pioneer of European Abstract Art, Russian-born artist Wassily Kandinsky wanted to free art from the confines of mere depiction. Instead, he aspired to use colours, lines, shapes and gestural marks to create a unique visual language capable of expressing ideas and arousing emotion in onlookers, much in the same way music stirs listeners. His pieces, such as Cossacks (1910), linked musical tones to colours, resulting in melodic and moving painterly displays.

Hilma af Klint, 1862-1944
Although widely regarded as the forefather of artistic abstraction, abstract works by Swedish artist and mystic Hilma af Klint preceded those of Wassily and his peers. Despite the radical nature of her works, though, Hilma hid much of her practice from the public eye, convinced that the world wasn't ready to comprehend her creations. Her works remained largely unheard of until over three decades after her death. Greatly inspired by spirituality and theology, her colourful and revelatory paintings - such as the series The Paintings for the Temple (1906-1915) - continue to gain long-overdue precedence in the artistic canon.

Piet Mondrian, 1872-1944
Dutch painter and art theoretician Piet Mondrian began his career painting realistic landscapes before being influenced by Pointillism, Fauvism and Cubism. One of his most famous pieces, The Grey Tree, illustrates a significant shift in his practice from Figuratism to Cubism. His later works transitioned into an even more simplified, abstract style called Neo-Plasticism, a technique restricted to the three primary colours and grids of black crisscrossing lines with white backgrounds. For example, Composition B (No. II) with Red (1935).

Fahrelnissa Zeid, 1901-1991
Turkish artist Fahrelnissa Zeid was one of the first women to enter art school in Istanbul and is lauded for her large-scale abstract paintings. Distinguished by their dazzling, kaleidoscopic patterns, her paintings blend elements from Byzantine, Arab, Persian and European influences. References to mosaics, stained-glass windows and Islamic architecture abound in works such as Fight Against Abstraction (1947). A key figure in Western European and Middle Eastern Modernism, Fahrelnissa was heavily involved in the ​​avant-garde art movements in Istanbul, pre-war Berlin and post-war Paris.

Joan Miro, 1893-1983
Inspired by the Freudian notion of free association (the desire to reveal the workings of the unconscious mind), Joan Miro practised the liberating style of Automatism. This branch of abstraction enabled artists to develop their own sign language, giving illustrative form to their emotions. Joan used simplified shapes and coalesced expansive ranges of colour, as seen in oil-painting The Tilled Field (1923–1924), a visual metaphor for his homeland. Joan applied colours to paintings like writers devote words to poems, laying the foundation for the Abstract Expressionist movement to come.

Pablo Picasso, 1881-1973
It would be amiss not to mention Pablo Picasso. The artist believed that work would keep him alive, and he was quite right; he now lives on in our memory as one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Alongside George Braque, Picasso founded Cubism, a significant chapter of Abstract Art history that broke away from Renaissance tradition and its perspectival constraints. As seen in Bowl of Fruit, Violin and Bottle (1914), Cubism showed subjects from multiple angles on the same canvas.","
Abstract art, evolving throughout the 1900s, includes movements like Expressionism and Cubism. Key figures include Wassily Kandinsky, who linked musical tones to colors; Hilma af Klint, a pioneer in spiritual abstraction; Piet Mondrian, known for Neo-Plasticism; Fahrelnissa Zeid, who blended Eastern and Western influences; Joan Miro, who practiced Automatism; and Pablo Picasso, a founder of Cubism. These artists used shapes, colors, and forms to express emotions and ideas, moving beyond traditional representation."
"FAUVISM
Fauvism is the name applied to the work produced by a group of artists (which included Henri Matisse and André Derain) from around 1905 to 1910, which is characterised by strong colours and fierce brushwork

The name les fauves (‘the wild beasts’) was coined by the critic Louis Vauxcelles when he saw the work of Henri Matisse and André Derain in an exhibition, the salon d’automne in Paris, in 1905. The paintings Derain and Matisse exhibited were the result of a summer spent working together in Collioure in the South of France and were made using bold, non-naturalistic colours (often applied directly from the tube), and wild loose dabs of paint. The forms of the subjects were also simplified making their work appear quite abstract.

Other like-minded artists associated with fauvism included Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, Georges Rouault, and Maurice de Vlaminck.

Fauvism and colour theory
The fauvists were interested in the scientific colour theories developed in the nineteenth century – particularly those relating to complementary colours. Complementary colours are pairs of colours appear opposite each other on scientific models such as the colour wheel, and when used side-by-side in a painting make each other look brighter.

What inspired fauvism? (And what happened to it?)
Fauvism can be seen as an extreme extension of the post-impressionism of Van Gogh combined with the neo-impressionism of Seurat. The influences of these earlier movements inspired Matisse and his followers to reject traditional three-dimensional space and instead use flat areas or patches of colour to create a new pictorial space. Fauvism can also be seen as a form of expressionism in its use of brilliant colors and spontaneous brushwork. It has often been compared to German expressionism, which emerged at around the same time and was also inspired by the developments of post-impressionism.

Although one of the first avant-garde modernist movements of the twentieth century and one of the first styles to make a move towards abstraction, for many of the artists who adopted a fauvist approach it became a transitional stepping stone for future developments in their style. By 1908 most of the main artists in the group had moved away from the expressive emotionalism of fauvism. A renewed interest in post-impressionist artist Paul Cézanne and the analytical approach he took to painting landscapes, people and objects inspired many artists to embrace order and structure instead. One–time fauvist Georges Braque went on to develop cubism along with Pablo Picasso while one of fauvism’s founders André Derain adopted a more conventional neoclassical style. Henri Matisse however continued to use the distinctive fauvist traits of bright emotive colours, simple shapes and painterly mark-making throughout his career. ","Fauvism, active from 1905 to 1910 and led by Henri Matisse and André Derain, is known for its strong, non-naturalistic colors and fierce brushwork. Coined 'the wild beasts', Fauvists emphasized bright, complementary colors and simplified forms, influenced by post-impressionism and neo-impressionism. While a pivotal modernist movement, Fauvism was a transitional style for many artists, with some like Georges Braque moving to Cubism, while Matisse continued using its distinctive traits throughout his career."
"Woman with a Hat (Femme au chapeau)
Artist: Henri Matisse

Henri Matisse exhibited this painting at the 1905 Salon d'Automne in Paris. Up to this point, Matisse had primarily painted realistic, academically accepted works, but, like, many of his contemporaries, he became frustrated by what he viewed as the inherent limitations of the traditional style. In this work, Matisse depicts his wife rendered expressively in bright, rather than realistic, hues.

Representative of the growing desire amongst artists to express more of their own inner world, this work was an extremely powerful statement at its time. Matisse had been influenced by the structural depictions of Paul Cézanne, the flatness and boldness of Paul Gauguin, and even the Pointillist precision of Georges Seurat, but Matisse's interest in expressing emotions and defining space through color stood apart. Becoming known as Fauvism, the vivid, expressive use of color and lack of adherence to realistic depictions of space seen here remained constants in much of his work, and inspired others who were also grappling with the desire to move past realistic art in order to express something more personal.

Hilma af Klint: Group IV, The Ten Largest, No. 7, Adulthood (1907)
1907
Group IV, The Ten Largest, No. 7, Adulthood
Artist: Hilma af Klint

It has been suggested that Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky, or Kazimir Malevich invented nonobjective art, however, some of the earliest known examples come from the revolutionary artist Hilma af Klint. While she initially created traditionally figurative works, Klint's radical paintings came out of her interest in spiritualism. A movement much in vogue among artistic and literary circles at the time, Spiritualism held that it was possible to communicate with spirits of the dead. Along with a group of four other women latter dubbed ""The Five"", Klint held seances and meditated, ultimately coming to believe a spirit named Amaliel assigned her to create paintings to decorate a temple. Claiming Amaliel guided her hand, the artist worked feverishly, creating 193 paintings for the project by 1915. As a result of her own recognition of the radical nature of the works, Klint shrouded them in secrecy, stipulating they not be revealed until 20 years after her death. Despite this provision, it was not until 1986 that her work came to attention, and is only now receiving the consideration it deserves: New York's Guggenheim's 2019 Klint exhibition was the most visited show in the museum's history.

This painting belongs to a group of works depicting the stages of human life from conception to death. As is evident in this example, Klint's abstract paintings featured biomorphic shapes reminiscent of biological processes, calligraphy, and clouds in a range of colors. During the creation of these works, Klint wrote over 26,000 pages of notes explaining the themes of her paintings and a lexicon of symbols, accompanied by glossaries and translations of her language. According to Klint, spirals were intended to represent evolution while overlapping discs were symbolic of unity. The discovery of her complex abstractions has completely disrupted the notion that nonobjective work did not come about until the 1920s.

Pablo Picasso: Still Life with Compote and Glass (Nature morte au compotier) (1914-15)
1914-15
Still Life with Compote and Glass (Nature morte au compotier)
Artist: Pablo Picasso

Inspired by Cézanne's interest in geometric forms and multiple perspectives, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque pioneered the Cubism movement, which aimed to present a scene rendered from multiple perspectives. This manifested itself through the conversion of objects to flattened, often geometric, shapes. In this work, the guitar is primarily represented in the center in the white shape. The glass of wine and bottle are formed from cut out bits of paper and pieces of newsprint are also included. Cafés, very popular at the time, were a recurring subject in Cubist works. Creating works with contemporary life as the subject matter was still fairly new, whilst the extreme simplification of the scene and its disengagement with realistic portrayals of space makes the artwork experimental, with Picasso himself noting that ""I paint objects as I think them not as I see them"".

While Picasso never became a fully abstract artist, Cubism represented a significant move towards complete abstraction. Cubism's use of geometric shapes was enormously influential on later artists who created artworks through the use of simple squares, rectangles, circles and lines. This famously includes the work of Mondrian, Malevich, and Rothko. Mondrian actively acknowledged his debt to the Cubists, but suggested that they did not realize the power of their own work, stating that ""Cubism did not accept the logical consequences of its own discoveries; it was not developing abstraction towards its own goal, the expression of pure reality""","
This summary explores three pivotal art movements through key works: Henri Matisse's ""Woman with a Hat"" embodies Fauvism with expressive, bright colors; Hilma af Klint's ""Group IV, The Ten Largest, No. 7, Adulthood"" represents early abstract art influenced by spiritualism; and Pablo Picasso's ""Still Life with Compote and Glass"" showcases Cubism's fragmented, geometric representation. These artists broke traditional boundaries, paving the way for abstract art and altering the course of 20th-century art history.

"No. 14, 1960
Artist: Mark Rothko

Alongside his contemporaries in the postwar period who were searching for meaning in life and art, Rothko experimented with different ways to express deep emotion and to make these accessible to the viewer. His early paintings, while abstract, featured recognizable forms inspired by myth, prehistory, and biology. Later, he began to replace figures and narrative with color and shape, ultimately arriving at his mature style, which is seen in this painting.

Here, the artist's thin layers of color seem to have a life of their own as a result of the feathered and layered brushwork, resulting in a sense of pulsating movement. His intention with works such as these was to call up associations with primal human emotion. As a result, he had specific instructions for his paintings to be mounted in order to have the horizontal line between the rectangles come close to the viewer's height as well as dim lighting, resulting in a feeling of being enveloped by the paintings.

Art historian James Breslin notes that his works, ""seem to locate a viewer at a 'doorway' between the physical and transcendent worlds"" and that they ""provide a public stage on which the human and the transcendent can be rejoined"". In keeping with this extreme form of abstraction, Rothko chose to title his works with numbers in order to eliminate any possibility of association. Through abstraction, Rothko's goal was to create transcendent and timeless works that speak to the overall human condition. Rothko's emphasis on color as a means of expression, his exploration of the sublime and spiritual, and his invitation for viewers to engage in an intimate encounter with his work all contributed to the evolution of abstract art.

Kenneth Noland: Sarah's Reach (1964)

1964
Sarah's Reach
Artist: Kenneth Noland

Though Kenneth Noland started out as an Abstract Expressionist, he later became part of a group of artists practicing Post-Painterly Abstraction. Noland's recognizable style came about after a trip he, and fellow painter Morris Louis, took to Helen Frankenthaler's studio in 1953. Both were inspired by her technique of applying washes of color to unprimed canvas, and each took it in a different direction.

From the late-1950s Noland created works featuring concentric circles, taking artist Jasper Johns' famous targets as inspiration. These works stood apart from others in the Abstract Expressionism movement through their highly-refined sharp-edged shapes. Noland continued to work with flat colors and symmetry, experimenting with different shapes such as chevrons, diamonds, horizontal bands, and plaid patterns, later venturing into the use of shaped canvases. Sarah's Reach features plunging diagonal diamond-shapes with bright, flat, unmodulated color over a purely white background. While the image itself is static, there is a sense of movement and dynamism as a result of the color and strong diagonal lines converging to the left and lower portion of the canvas.

Noland's work and that of other artists working after Abstract Expressionism was most notable in its lack of interest in the mystical nature of the movement as well as their focus on exploring the formal nature of the medium even further. This interest resulted in an emphasis on the flatness of the canvas, simple shapes, and strong, unmodulated colors. On the importance of color to his work, Noland stated: ""I wanted to have color be the origin of the painting. I was trying to neutralize the layout, the shape, the composition. I wanted to make color the generating force."" While this work does not easily open itself up to interpretation, that is the point. Noland and his contemporaries ultimately brought the exploration of the process, production, and meaning of painting to its very limits.

Christopher Wool: Untitled (2007)

2007
Untitled
Artist: Christopher Wool

Christopher Wool's incisive artistic process questions the very nature of painting and replication. He first came to renown with his paintings featuring decorative black patterns on a white background created with rollers and stamps. Inspired by graffiti, in the late 1980s Wool created his signature ""word paintings"", which included stenciled words rendered in deliberately playful and provocative ways.

This work belongs to his ""gray paintings"" series. Questioning the nature of reproduction, in the early 2000's, Wool began to incorporate silkscreen printing, and, sometimes beginning with one of his own paintings, would add spray paint and paint rollers onto the base image, purposefully featuring smudges and accidents in the style of Andy Warhol. This process resulted in various layers that suggest depth while simultaneously hiding parts of the surface. As a post-conceptual artist, Wool delights in the tension between addition and loss as well as between creation and destruction. This work exemplifies this interest, featuring lines that look back to Abstract Expressionism before being smudged over, challenging the notion of the genius of the artist's hand.

More recently, Wool has delved into photography and sculpture. While he has often worked from his photographs, lately he has published volumes of them in order to emphasize their importance to his paintings and as works of art in their own right. His 1993 Absent Without Leave featured urban scenes from cities run through a photocopier, degrading the image. His most recent publication features images of sculptures created from found wire in his home in Marfa, Texas. What remains constant in Wool's work is an emphasis on the nature of abstraction and reproduction, making the viewer think about where his work in different media fits in the ever-changing realm of abstract art","
This summary highlights three influential abstract artists: Mark Rothko, known for his emotional color fields, inviting viewers into a transcendent experience; Kenneth Noland, who moved from Abstract Expressionism to Post-Painterly Abstraction, focusing on symmetry, flat colors, and geometric shapes, as seen in ""Sarah's Reach""; and Christopher Wool, who questions painting and replication through layered works incorporating silkscreen, spray paint, and rollers. Each artist uniquely contributed to the evolution and exploration of abstract art."
"Impressionism
Claude Monet's <i>Le Printemps</i> (1886) is an early example of Impressionism
Impressionism arose in the late-19th century in Paris. Painters including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir were interested in creating images of contemporary life with an emphasis on capturing movement and the changing qualities of light. Their works were characterized by being painted outdoors (en plein air), visible brushstrokes, and the use of pure, unmixed colors. As Impressionism developed, artists began to increase the degree of abstraction in their work, even dispensing with horizon lines and clear forms altogether. Monet was perhaps the most extreme; his late work, from the 1920s, features abstraction to such a degree that, at times, the depicted subject is not apparent to the viewer. While not all Impressionist works are viewed as strictly abstract, many are seen as proto-abstract as a result of their painterly and subjective renderings.

Post-Impressionism
<i>The Olive Trees</i> (1889) epitomizes van Gogh's use of outline and patterning in his proto-abstract paintings
Many artists working in an Impressionist style began to seek new ways to express themselves personally through their art, often engaging more with abstraction in the process. Rather than the Impressionists' painterly style, Paul Gauguin experimented with emphasizing areas of solid color and defined forms with outlines, dispensing with traditional perspective. He also used color symbolically and referred to his style as Synthetism, in that he used formal elements to convey his feelings. Vincent van Gogh also moved away from traditional perspective, which is particularly evident in his depictions of the sky, featuring flat blues with stars or clouds overlaid in a pattern-like fashion. His paintings were characterized by thick brushstrokes and brilliant hues.

While Gauguin and van Gogh both engaged with abstraction out of a desire for personal expression, Georges Seurat and Paul Cézanne were more interested in structural composition. Seurat created a style he called Pointillism where different dots of pure color were painted next to one another. When viewed closely his paintings appear to be an abstract assortment of colors, but from a distance they form a coherent and unified scene. Cézanne was concerned in exploring the use of planes and intense color to represent depth, stating ""I seek to render perspective only through color"". This ultimately led him to depict objects as they appeared from multiple perspectives simultaneously. While not totally abstract, all of these artists worked with abstraction in some form, and the personal expression and compositional freedom shown in their pieces, influenced other artists to take abstraction even further.

Cubism
Inspired by Cézanne's experimentation, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque pioneered Cubism as a way to represent three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional canvas. This resulted in the simplification of a scene into its key constituent parts and the use of geometric shapes to depict objects and people. Although Cubist paintings were based in reality, their aggressive engagement with shapes resulted in many of their paintings appearing completely abstract to the viewer. Cubism went farther into abstraction than Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, establishing an engagement with the flatness of the canvas and new abstract ways to represent reality.

Complete Abstraction
<i>Kandinsky's Un Centro</i> (1924) is an example of the artist's dynamic abstractions
There is some debate about who created the first completely abstract work of art, Wassily Kandinsky claimed this honor for himself and he was certainly one of the early artists to engage with purely nonrepresentational art. Though he initially created realistic and then semi-abstract works, Kandinsky wanted to create works that depicted the way he felt when listening to music. A theorist in addition to artist, in 1911, he wrote the influential text Concerning the Spiritual in Art, in which he linked different colors with specific emotions and musical notes, a response that we now recognize as synesthesia, a rare condition where two senses are linked. He began to create entirely nonobjective art in the same year and his abstract works contain a sense of rhythm and joy, entirely evocative of the music that he loved.

Recently, however, the work of Swedish painter, Hilma af Klint has come to greater attention and it is now believed that she created completely abstract art some years earlier than Kandinsky, in 1906. Klint studied art at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm and after graduation worked as a portrait and landscape painter. As a young woman, she discovered Theosophy, a religious movement that had links to spiritualism and this shaped her early abstract works. She believed that she was being guided by spirits and she sought to capture these invisible forces on canvas. As a result, between November 1906 and March 1907 she created a series of works called Primordial Chaos, some of which have a representative element whilst others are fully abstract. She followed this with another abstract series of large works called The Ten Biggest and she continued to develop her abstraction through the 1910s, moving from more organic forms to geometric ones. At the time of her death in 1944, none of her abstract works had been exhibited and they did not come to wider attention until many years later.

Other pioneers of completely abstract art included Piet Mondrian, whose abstract art was also rooted in the Theosophy movement. He produced his first non-representational pieces in 1913, stating that he sought ""to articulate a mystic conception of cosmic harmony that lay behind the surfaces of reality"". Throughout the next two decades, he continued to refine and simplify his compositions. Around the same time, Russian avant-garde artist, Kasimir Malevich also began to experiment with geometric abstraction and around 1915, he produced Black Square. This consisted of a simple black square painted onto a white background. It was the most radically abstract painting yet to be created and as Russian essayist, Tatyana Tolstaya, argues, it ""once and for all drew an uncrossable line that demarcated the chasm between old art and new art"".

Dada
Dada started in 1916 in Zurich in direct reaction to the horrors experienced in World War I. Questioning the very fundamentals of society itself, and, in extension, art, its advocates turned from traditional painting and sculpture to nontraditional media and methods. Proponents advocated strategies such as collaboration, spontaneity, and chance, and, while the movement was not entirely abstract, abstraction was a logical arena to be explored in that it had the ability to represent non-rational subjects. Francis Picabia created paintings featuring mechanical forms with no relation to reality, whilst Jean (Hans) Arp exploited the nature of chance, creating abstract works out of bits of paper thrown in the air and glued where they fell. Arp's techniques were influential on both Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism. Instead of using rational thought to plan out an image, the inclusion of elements of chance allowed artists to completely free their minds while creating their art.

Surrealism
Arshile Gorky used automatic drawing to create Surrealist painting <i>Garden of Wish Fulfilment</i> (1944)
Like Dada, while Surrealism was not an entirely abstract movement, many of its practitioners made steps that resulted in significant advances in abstraction. The movement was originally literary, and their engagement with automatic writing, intended to facilitate access to the unconscious, spread into the visual arts in a variety of techniques. Surrealists also incorporated Dada's interest in new media and chance into the pseudo-abstract techniques, decalcomania and grattage. Decalcomania consisted of pressing paint between sheets of paper, while grattage was scratching wet paint with a tool and working with the patterns or images that emerged.

André Masson, who had briefly been associated with Cubism, began to create free-association drawings featuring continuous lines, out of which figures and recognizable forms sometimes appeared. As a result of World War II, Masson was exiled to New York and continued his artistic investigation of automatism, ultimately influencing the New York School. Joan Miró, on the other hand, merged automatist drawing with abstract forms alongside vestiges of realistic representation. His Surrealist work was ultimately reliant upon a unique lexicon of symbols and figures from an artistic language he developed over many years. Roberto Matta also merged automatism with abstraction; early on, he eschewed figuration in favor of using abstract symbols in an attempt to represent his inner world.

Abstract Expressionism
<i>Sabra</i> (1966) by Abstract Expressionist Franz Kline is an example of Action Painting.
Abstract Expressionism was the first entirely abstract movement in the United States. It emerged in the late-1940s and 1950s, partly in reaction to World War II. Looking back to Archaic and Indigenous art as well as automatism and Jungian psychology, members of the New York School searched for ways to express their own psyches that would tap into universal emotions in order to be timeless. The two major iterations of the movement were Action Painting and Color Field painting.

Jackson Pollock was an exponent of the former. He began to pour and drip paint onto unmounted, unprimed canvas on the floor, often stepping into the painting during the process. He created entirely nonobjective paintings in which the only sense of illusion lay in drips of paint lying on top of one another. Willem de Kooning, was also an Action Painter, working in an abstract fashion while utilizing recognizable imagery, as in his Women series. In this he sought to create a metaphorical, iconic symbol of women, alluding to prehistoric cave women as well as modern-day advertisements. In reaction to the gestural nature of action paintings, artists Kenneth Noland and Ellsworth Kelly created paintings termed Hard Edge Abstraction, so named because they emphasized clear forms based on simple shapes and monochromatic, smooth paint application with bright colors squeezed straight from the tube. This technique consciously removed the personal elements from Abstract Expressionism.

In contrast to these paintings, which are characterized by an active, painterly surface, Color Field painters created large-scale works dominated by a few hues carefully applied in solid swathes. These fields of colors attempted to envelop the viewer, engendering a sense of the smallness of self in face of the unknowable. Barnett Newman's mature works consisted of a monochrome hue punctuated by vertical striations he termed ""zips"", which were intended to result in the sense of an encounter with an elemental presence on the part of the viewer. Mark Rothko arrived at his stacked rectangles in 1949. In various color combinations, the works are characterized by their vertical orientation with two or three horizontal rectangles hovering on the canvas, with the content lying in the color and simple shapes. Scaled to human size and hung low, like Newman's ""zips"", standing before these paintings can result in feeling a sense of contact with an otherworldly presence. Growing out of Color Field Painting, Post-Painterly Abstraction was a group of related movements. As part of these, Helen Frankenthaler notably created a soak stain technique, which she used to create abstractions based on nature. Other artists such as Morris Louis and Jules Olitski used this in their own more decorative abstract paintings.

Art Informel
Art Informel is often viewed as the European equivalent to Abstract Expressionism and arose in a similar time period. It was an umbrella term for a variety of movements that emphasized intuition over rationality in the hopes of creating universally accessible art. Tachisme, one iteration of Art Informel, started in France. Named for the French word tache, meaning ""stain"" or ""spot"", the movement was characterized by a gestural, intuitive application of paint, featuring large brushstrokes, drips, and splashes of color.

This style of abstraction featured in the experimental output of both the CoBrA group in central Europe and the Gutai group in Japan. CoBrA artists drew inspiration from ancient Nordic myths, children's drawings, and art created by the mentally ill. In a bright palette with a free hand, many of their works featured abstracted, fantastic animals, which they believed to be symbolic of the bestial nature of humanity revealed by the Second World War. Gutai artists, on the other hand, sought to capture the ""spirit of life"" stating in their 1956 manifesto that ""We have decided to pursue enthusiastically the possibilities of pure creativity. We believe that by merging human qualities and material properties, we can concretely comprehend abstract space.""

Op Art and Minimalism
The Op Art movement of the 1960s focused on the creation of works that appeared to move as a result of color relationships and patterns. Thus, while epitomizing an allover canvas like Jackson Pollock, it was with a complete lack of interest in a metaphorical expression of self. Minimalism is often viewed as a form of extreme abstraction in that there was no intention of meaning apart from the self-referentiality of the object through an emphasis on form and material. The subject matter of Minimalist paintings consisted of grids, geometric shapes or lines, or even an investigation of a painting composed of black or white paint. Minimal sculptors often preferred the term ""objects"" for their work, and utilized industrial materials such as steel, fiberglass, and plexiglass. ","This summary traces the evolution of abstract art, beginning with Impressionism's focus on light and movement, transitioning to Post-Impressionism's personal expression and structural composition. Cubism further abstracted reality with geometric forms. Complete abstraction emerged with Kandinsky and af Klint, focusing on nonrepresentational art. Abstract Expressionism in the U.S. expressed deeper psyches, while Art Informel in Europe emphasized intuition. Op Art and Minimalism later explored visual effects and form-focused art."
"Key Ideas & Accomplishments
Political instability in Europe in the 1930s brought several leading Surrealists to New York, and many of the Abstract Expressionists were profoundly influenced by Surrealism's focus on mining the unconscious. It encouraged their interest in myth and archetypal symbols and it shaped their understanding of painting itself as a struggle between self-expression and the chaos of the subconscious.
Most of the artists associated with Abstract Expressionism matured in the 1930s. They were influenced by the era's leftist politics, and came to value an art grounded in personal experience. Few would maintain their earlier radical political views, but many continued to adopt the posture of outspoken avant-gardists.
Having matured as artists at a time when America suffered economically and felt culturally isolated and provincial, the Abstract Expressionists were later welcomed as the first authentically American avant-garde. Their art was championed for being emphatically American in spirit - monumental in scale, romantic in mood, and expressive of a rugged individual freedom.
Although the movement has been largely depicted throughout historical documentation as one belonging to the paint-splattered, heroic male artist, there were several important female Abstract Expressionists that arose out of New York and San Francisco during the 1940s and '50s who now receive credit as elemental members of the canon","
In the 1930s, political instability in Europe brought Surrealists to New York, influencing Abstract Expressionists with a focus on the unconscious and myth. These artists, shaped by the era's leftist politics and America's economic and cultural isolation, formed the first American avant-garde, known for its monumental scale and individualistic spirit. Historically dominated by male narratives, the movement also included significant female Abstract Expressionists, whose contributions are now recognized as fundamental to the movement."
"Summary of William Morris
Few artists left such a wide and indelible mark on the art, culture, and politics of their era as William Morris did on the second half of the nineteenth century. Training first as a priest and then as an architect before abandoning both to realize his visions of medieval arcadia in the company of the Pre-Raphaelites, he moved between artistic and literary media throughout his life. Initially producing paintings in the sweet Quattrocento style of his Pre-Raphaelite contemporaries, most notably Dante Gabriel Rossetti, he soon branched out into architecture and interior design, creating some of the most commercially successful and enduringly admired textile patterns and furnishings in British art history. Towards the end of his life, Morris focused with increasing singularity on the radical political ambitions which had always underpinned his practice, publishing utopian socialist fantasy literature, and consolidating his lifelong work as a poet. When he died in 1896, he had not only left a deep imprint on the century he had lived through, but also laid the groundwork for many of the artistic, architectural and political projects which defined the next.

Accomplishments
William Morris is often seen as the grandfather of the international Arts and Crafts Movement. In an era of increasing industrialism and urbanization, he embraced an idealized vision of the artisanship and cottage industries of the Middle Ages. For Morris, art was nothing if it was not a product of craftsmanship: a collaborative, spiritually imbued activity by which human beings grew together in kinship, and in connection to their natural environment. Inspired partly by the art historian John Ruskin, Morris's Arts and Crafts aesthetic directly or indirectly influenced a huge swath of artistic and literary movements over the coming decades, from Art Nouveau to the artists' books of the Futurists and Dadaists.
William Morris was the first artist of the modern era to combine word and image in the expression of his vision. Following in the footsteps of that other great London-born radical and luminary William Blake, Morris developed an aesthetic in which the words printed on a hanging tapestry, for example, or in a hand-printed manuscript, were as reliant on their surrounding pattern-work for meaning as the images were on the text. This notion of a multi-media art practice, though realized in the context of a nostalgic medievalism, pre-empted the more overtly radical art-and-language experiments of the twentieth century, from Constructivist book design to Concrete Poetry.
Like his mentor Rossetti, William Morris preferred to work in the company of friends, creative collaborators with whom he shared an artistic and spiritual worldview. It has often been argued that these collective endeavors, like those of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to which Morris was partially connected, pre-empt the notion of the avant-garde which held sway over radical artistic culture for much of the following century. If the definition of the avant-garde involves a radical, collective aesthetic vision infused with utopian political aims, then Morris's and his companions' activities certainly fit the bill. ","William Morris, influential in the late 19th century, was a multifaceted artist and a key figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement. Initially a painter, he later excelled in architecture, textile design, and literature, promoting craftsmanship and a connection with nature. His integration of word and image influenced future artistic movements. A mentor to many, Morris's collaborative, avant-garde approach merged art with utopian socialism, leaving a lasting impact on various artistic and political spheres."
"La Belle Iseult
Although this painting has been listed since its creation as 'unfinished', it is the only easel painting by Morris to reach this level of near-completion, and a quintessential work of Pre-Raphaelite-era portraiture. The model for the painting was Jane Burden, Morris's soon-to-be wife, and it is believed that he started work on it very early during their courtship. The artist reportedly struggled during the composition process with the proportions of the human body, which he was never able to execute as effectively as his peers. It is rumored that when he stopped working on the painting, he scribbled a note on the back to Jane: ""I cannot paint you, but I love you"".

Jane poses as the female protagonist of the story of Tristram and Iseult (Tristan and Isolde), a legend of Celtic origin made popular during the medieval period by the treatment of Thomas Mallory, on which Morris based his composition. The narrative of doomed lovers contains all the aspects of Medieval romance - thwarted desire, chastity, honor, chivalry - that attracted the Pre-Raphaelites to the literature and art of the period. In the scene depicted, Iseult is mourning the exile of Tristram - a knight sent to fetch her from Ireland to marry King Mark of Cornwall, only for the two to fall in love en route - from her husband's court. The tale was one that Morris had previously represented in the Oxford Union Murals, and the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite artists with whom he undertook that project, particularly Rossetti, is obvious. At the same time, we might trace a thread of affinity with the nascent Symbolist movement in continental Europe, given the heavily allegorical nature of the composition. The dog on the bed, given to Iseult by Tristram in Mallory's story, stands for loyalty, the rosemary in her crown for remembrance.

The painting also alludes in various ways to Morris's artistic and personal biography. Whilst figural painting would never be his true calling, we can sense clues as to his future endeavors as a designer and craftsman in the finer details of the scene. On the bed is an illuminated manuscript similar to those Morris would produce with Kelmscott Press, while the lavish textiles and tapestries are reminiscent of those Morris would spend most of his career creating. As for his model, Jane's strong, striking features, which epitomized the Pre-Raphaelite ideal of beauty, also caught the attention of Morris's friend and mentor Rossetti, with whom Jane embarked on a lifelong affair, grudgingly tolerated by her husband.

Red House (1860)
1860
Red House
Created in collaboration with the architect Philip Webb, many consider this building the jewel in Morris's crown. After his marriage to Jane, Morris longed for a country home for the family, a place where he could live out his visions of medieval romance and collaborative creativity. The result was a strange and magnificent red brick construction which brought together the pointed arches of Gothic religious architecture, the gabled roofs of a Tudor mansion, and turrets from a medieval fairytale. This was not just a house to be lived in, but to be explored and experienced: for Rossetti, it was ""more a poem than a house"".

Everything in the creation and decoration of Red House was carefully considered. Perhaps in a nod to Morris's growing socialist principles, the red bricks of working-class housing were favored over the stone blocks that would have befitted his class status. He also abandoned bourgeoise taste by filling the garden with native British trees and flowers - those which inspired his decorative designs - rather than the exotic plants favored by the upper classes.

The decoration of the house has become as famous as its architecture, a collaborative endeavor involving not just Morris and Webb, but all of their artistic friends as well. Apparently, whenever a guest arrived to view the completed building, they would be invited to assist with its decoration. Morris would even prick out his designs in plaster, for less creatively inclined friends. The result is a work of interior decoration which showcases the talents of some of the best-known artists of the era. Murals, painted panels and chests, stained-glass windows and textiles: all were created in the spirit of collective joy and industry that Morris so valued.

Red House has been seen as the ancestral home of the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain. Its construction also marked a decisive shift in architectural aesthetics, one whose effects were still playing out in the early twentieth century. In 1904, the German critic Hermann Muthesius described Red House as ""the first house to be conceived and built as a unified whole, inside and out, the very first example in the history of the modern home"". This concept would be hugely influential on architects of the Art Nouveau era such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, and modernists such as Walter Gropius. 150 years after its construction, the building, now owned by the National Trust, continues to fascinate and excite visitors.

Green Dining Room (1868)
1868
Green Dining Room
This Green Dining Room (also knonw as the Morris Room) is one of three refreshment rooms created for the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) during the 1860s. This commission was not given to Morris alone, but to Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., the company known as The Firm. The prestige of this commission was a testament to the critical and commercial success that Morris and his collaborators had been enjoying since establishing The Firm in 1861. The individuals chiefly involved in this project were Morris, Philip Webb, and Edward Burne-Jones. As with their other joint-endeavors, each worked on the sections of the room that best suited their skills. The Green Dining Room thus embodies the spirit of collaborative artisanship which the company championed.

As the resident architect of the group, Webb designed the window frames, working with Morris on the floral and geometric designs pricked into the plaster of the ceiling. Burne-Jones painted the paneled frieze along the walls of the room, and, as an accomplished stained-glass designer, filled the window panels with scenes of medieval domestic bliss, including the ubiquitous, lissome Pre-Raphaelite beauties. The patterns inscribed into the green-painted plaster walls were the work of Morris alone, however. Olive boughs, raised up in the plaster, wrap around the room in an endless pattern, punctuated by the splashes of color introduced by flowers and berries. While these walls were created as reliefs, the designs pre-empt those Morris would later create for wallpapers and furnishing fabrics, particularly Willow. The latter is one of Morris's best-known designs, a simple pattern of intertwined willow leaves that gives the ""unmistakable suggestions of gardens and fields"" within a domestic setting.

Strawberry Thief (1883)
1883
Strawberry Thief
Strawberry Thief is the best known of Morris's decorative textile designs, one on which he worked for several months before finding a way of printing it successfully. The fabric was intended to be used for curtains or hung along walls, a medieval style of decoration which the artist advocated. The pattern, meanwhile, was based on the thrushes that would steal strawberries from the kitchen in his country home at Kelmscott Manner, and was therefore imbued with nostalgic sentiment. Whilst the foliate designs are complex and eye-catching, and the design provides little depth between foreground and background, the birds remain a focal point due to their light color and the naturalism of their rendering. They also create an element of narrative interest, as the mischievous protagonists of a story that plays out across the surface of the fabric, entertaining with their song while they make away with the precious berries.

These themes are redolent of the natura naturans spirit of much medieval textile art, and loosely evocative of the romance and fantasy narratives of the same era. In practical terms, Morris took a great deal of interest in the practical craftsmanship of the Strawberry Thief design, learning the theory of fabric-dyeing and block-printing in order to create a pattern amenable to his chosen production process. Eventually, he settled on the ancient technique of indigo discharge, in spite of its costly and laborious nature, applying bleached blocks to dyed fabric. His main concern was the depth of color in the finished product, and the artisanal authenticity of the creative process.

This design has attained extraordinary commercial success since its release in the late nineteenth century, and continues to sell widely, with English department stores having featured it in several high-end fashion collaborations. Its popularity has recently led the Victoria and Albert Museum's designer-in-residence to create a digital game based on the design, while contemporary artists continue to look back to it. The conceptual and video artist Jeremy Deller, for example, has named an exhibition after the work, and created the piece Strawberry Thief (2014), a neon light depicting one of the birds with a captured berry, in homage to it.","William Morris, a central figure in the Pre-Raphaelite movement, created diverse works including the nearly-complete painting ""La Belle Iseult"" and the innovative Red House, combining various architectural styles. His Green Dining Room showcased collaborative artisanship, while ""Strawberry Thief,"" one of his most famous textile designs, reflected medieval influences and meticulous craftsmanship. His works spanned painting, architecture, and design, leaving a lasting impact on the Arts and Crafts Movement and beyond."
"Childhood
William Morris was born in 1834 in Walthamstow, Essex, the third of nine children. William's father, after whom he was named, was a self-made business man, who was able to provide an upper-middle-class lifestyle for his family because of a shrewd investment in a Devonshire mine. Although William Morris Senior died when his son was just thirteen, the wealth he had accumulated provided a generous income for the artist well into his adult life.

As a child, Morris lived something of an idyllic lifestyle in his family's large country house near Epping Forest in Essex, surrounded by ancient woodland scattered with medieval architecture. He was sent to school at the prestigious Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where he claimed to have ""learned next to nothing"". Shirking his schoolwork, Morris spent his time reading, following his own interests, and exploring the landscape surrounding the school, including medieval churches and Neolithic monuments. Surviving letters from this period, written when Morris was as young as fourteen, reveal a deep love and critical appreciation of architecture. The sites and hobbies of his childhood would be carried with Morris for the rest of his life, influencing his design-work, and standing as points of repeated, nostalgic return in his writing.

Education and Early Training
In 1853, Morris began his studies in Theology at Exeter College, Oxford, planning to become a priest in line with his mother's wishes. However, within less than a year, his outlook on life had changed drastically: his reading in the library shifted from religious matters to history and ecclesiastical architecture, and eventually to the art criticism of John Ruskin. Soon, he discovered his lifelong passion for writing poetry, and his fate as a creative was sealed when he met fellow student Edward Burne-Jones, a budding artist and designer with whom he would remain friends for the rest of his life. Morris was connected to a group of students at Oxford known as the Birmingham Set, also including the mathematician Charles Faulkner and the poet Richard Watson Dixon, with shared interests in theology, medievalism, and the poetry of Alfred Lord Tennyson.

On graduating in 1856, Morris and Burne-Jones moved to London: Burne-Jones to work as a painter and designer of stained-glass, Morris to become an architect, a change of direction that was badly received by his family. Following his passions nonetheless, Morris started an apprenticeship. However, his career soon took another turn when he made the acquaintance of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. This close-knit group, established by Rossetti, William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais in 1948, had actually disbanded two years previously. But the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite aesthetic on British art would radiate across the following decades, thanks in part to the new creative triumvirate forged by the meeting of Rossetti, Morris, and Burne-Jones. Morris was swept up in a wave of artistic creativity, in the company of artists whose work focused on nature, and the romantic chivalry of the medieval past. These ideals were ones that Morris himself had championed since his childhood, and at last he found himself in company where he was free to explore them. Encouraged by Rossetti and Burne-Jones, Morris abandoned his architectural career and began painting in the Pre-Raphaelite style.

Mature Period
Morris threw himself into the bohemian lifestyle of the group, painting long-haired medieval women in natural landscapes similar to those found in Rossetti's watercolors - though Morris's paintings never received quite the same critical acclaim as those of his Pre-Raphaelite peers. In 1857, Morris, Rossetti, and Burne-Jones returned to Oxford to paint murals on the walls of the Union Library. The same year, Morris met Jane Burden, a beautiful, working-class girl who began to model for his and Rossetti's paintings. Morris fell in love with her, and by 1859 they were married.

Around this period, Morris's creative imagination was leading him beyond painting. He was interested in how the aesthetics and ethics of the Pre-Raphaelites - a love of nature, medieval aesthetics and Gothic architecture, a hatred of mechanization - might be applied across a wide range of artforms and applied crafts. At the same time, the artist yearned for a home outside the city in which he could raise a family. These ambitions converged in the design of ""Red House"", completed in 1860 in collaboration with the Gothic architect Philip Webb. Red House is an architectural masterpiece, encapsulating what became known as the Arts and Crafts aesthetic. Its sloping gabled roofs, painted brick fireplaces, and rambling cottage garden epitomized the new paradigm of beauty which the Pre-Raphaelites had defined in their paintings, but realized those ideals in three dimensions: this, in a nutshell, defined the Arts and Crafts philosophy. Situated close to London, Red House would become the country get-away of Morris's artistic acquaintances for the next five years.

After the house was built, Morris and his friends decided to decorate the interiors themselves, establishing through creative collaboration many of the principles of Arts-and-Crafts interior design. Burne-Jones designed the stained-glass windows, while Morris created the murals with help from Rossetti and other members of the wider Pre-Raphaelite circle. Around this time, Morris began to focus his attention on the wallpaper and textile designs which made him famous, some of which still survive in the house. This collaborative effort led to the founding of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., known as 'The Firm', an art and design company that championed hand-craftsmanship and traditional techniques with a strongly medievalist aesthetic. Members included Rossetti, Webb, and Burne-Jones, as well as P.P. Marshall, Charles Faulkner, and Ford Madox Brown","William Morris, born in 1834, grew up in Essex and attended Marlborough College and Exeter College, Oxford. Initially aiming to become a priest, he switched to architecture before being influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, especially Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Morris married Jane Burden and embraced a bohemian lifestyle, eventually founding 'The Firm', an influential Arts and Crafts company. His work spanned painting, architecture, and design, contributing significantly to the medievalist aesthetic in art and crafts."
"Summary of Victor Horta
Many creative minds have been said to be undisciplined in their youth. Belgian architect Victor Horta's biographers have even gone further, describing him as ""lazy"" and a ""dunce"" as a teenager. Apparently, Horta's father eventually had enough, and as punishment, at age 16 Horta was sent to work on a construction site. There, as he later recalled, he had an epiphany, and saw the rest of his life laid out before him. Indeed, Horta would go on to become one of his country's most accomplished and innovative architects, and one of the first following Belgian independence to achieve international renown, as one of the founders of Art Nouveau in the 1890s. Horta turned to Art Deco as his professional fortunes declined in the aftermath of World War I, and though he was later to receive numerous honors late in life, he had faded largely into obscurity by the time of his death, and several of his key works have been lost. In the last fifty years Horta's reputation has dramatically recovered and he is now recognized for being one of the world's key designers at the dawn of the 20th century.

Accomplishments
Horta is famous for his pioneering work in Art Nouveau and the translation of the style from the decorative arts into architecture in the early 1890s. Horta's inventiveness with Art Nouveau helped to make it something of a national style in Belgium by 1900 before its swift demise in advance of World War I.
Horta's work in Art Nouveau is marked by a keen understanding of the capabilities of industrial advances with iron and glass as structure and infill. Horta's buildings disclose an honest handling of their materials' properties, particularly the ability of iron to be twisted and bent into hairpin forms that extend seamlessly into the accompanying décor, inside and out, making the buildings ""total works of art.""
Horta was an adaptable architect who transitioned from Art Nouveau to other styles such as Art Deco as public tastes dictated. Though Horta was respected during his lifetime for his brilliance with Art Nouveau, he himself predicted the style's own demise and that many of his works would be demolished eventually. ","Victor Horta, initially undisciplined in his youth, emerged as a groundbreaking Belgian architect and a founder of Art Nouveau. His work transformed industrial materials like iron and glass into fluid, organic forms, integrating them into the structure and décor of buildings. Despite a decline in popularity post-World War I and a shift to Art Deco, Horta's innovative designs have regained recognition, cementing his legacy as a key figure in early 20th-century architecture."
"The Legacy of Victor Horta
During the height of his career at the turn of the 20th century, Horta achieved international renown as an innovator. He was an especially strong influence on the French Art Nouveau architect Hector Guimard, whom Horta met once in 1894 and advised to ""banish the flower"" in favor of the stalk in Guimard's own explorations of style. Horta also inspired a large number of minor architects in Belgium and especially around Brussels, thereby making Art Nouveau a kind of ""national style"" around 1900. His 'whiplash' curves, nearly a trademark aesthetic, are often termed ""the Belgian line"" in architectural discourse.

Horta did not represent the complete trajectory of Art Nouveau in Belgium, however; on the other pole was Henry van de Velde, with whom Horta did not have a good relationship. Though he sometimes borrowed from Horta's curvilinear aesthetic, van de Velde was known much more to favor the Arts and Crafts, and eventually left Belgium in 1899 to become director of the Arts and Crafts school in Weimar, Germany, before being forced out at the start of World War I. Unlike Horta, van de Velde had come to architecture through painting and the decorative arts (with Horta it was the other way around, and Horta never painted, anyways). While van de Velde was a gifted and polemical writer, Horta was laconic and published very little, preferring to let his built work and designs speak for him.

Horta died during an era when Art Nouveau began to enter one of the darkest chapters of its history. He had foreseen that many of his works would likely be destroyed because of the nature of the style in many places as a passing fad. Most of his department stores have been demolished; his great branch of L'Innovation in Brussels of 1903 was remodeled and then destroyed in a fire in 1967, and most famously, the Maison du Peuple was dismantled in 1965 amid a public outcry.

Such is not the case with Horta's residential works. His students Jean Delhaye and Maxine Brunfaut did much to ensure the survival of several of Horta's key works, as did many private owners of the houses that he built in Brussels, and a great number of them still remain; some are even open to the public occasionally. Even the Waucquez Department Store in Brussels still stands, and is in large part preserved, having now been transformed into the Museum of the Comic Strip.

With the revival of scholarly attention on Art Nouveau between the 1950s and 1970s, Horta's image began to be rehabilitated. At first, much of Art Nouveau was considered to be a critical forerunner or embryonic form of the modern movement, part of the search for a style for the ""machine age"" as epitomized by the International Style of architecture at midcentury. But more recently, Art Nouveau has begun to be treated as a style worthy of its own scholarly treatment and Horta's image as one of the great Belgian architects has been restored. At the end of the 20th century, Horta's portrait and whiplash designs were featured on the 2000 Belgian franc note.

Railings from Horta's Maison du Peuple can now be seen in the Brussels subway station Horta (named for him). Today the Musée Horta is now located in his former house and studio, meticulously preserved, and dedicated to the cultivation of his legacy.","
Victor Horta, a key innovator in Art Nouveau, inspired many architects in Belgium, making the style nationally significant by 1900. His influence extended beyond Belgium, notably affecting Hector Guimard's work. Despite Art Nouveau's decline and the demolition of many of his buildings, Horta's residential works largely survive, fostering a resurgence in scholarly interest. His legacy, now celebrated, is preserved at the Musée Horta, his former house and studio."
"Summary of Antoni Gaudí
It is difficult for us today to believe that the most famous modern Spanish architect met his demise when, at age 73, he was run over by a tram and assumed to be an ordinary beggar for a full day before he was finally identified, too late to be nursed back to health. Yet Antoni Gaudí's pious Catholicism and devotion to a spartan regimen had come to define his character almost completely by the last decade of his life, which he devoted almost exclusively to the construction of his arguably most famous work, the Sagrada Família church in Barcelona. Over Gaudí's nearly fifty years of independent practice, he concocted and realized some of the most imaginative architectural forms in history, all of them in his native Catalonia, which have since become synonymous with the region's identity. The best-known - and most individualistic - representative of Catalan Modernisme (Art Nouveau), Gaudí has fascinated and inspired generations of architects, designers, and even engineers. Today his work attracts a global following with some of the most distinctive, idiosyncratic, and recognizable designs of all time.

Accomplishments
Gaudí's was highly innovative in terms of his explorations of structure, searching through a variety of regional styles before seizing on the parabolic, hyperbolic, and catenary masonry forms and inclined columns that he developed through weighted models in his workshop. These are often integrated with natural and highly symbolic religious imagery that encrust the structure with vibrant, colorful surfaces.
Gaudí's work is the most inventive, daring, and flamboyant of Catalan Modernisme (the Catalan strand of Art Nouveau) designers, but it is not uncharacteristic of the movement as a whole.
Gaudí's work is highly personal, in part due to his devout Catholicism, a faith that became increasingly fervent as his career progressed. In part because of this, his work contains many references to religious themes, and he increasingly led an ascetic existence towards the end of his life, even giving up all other commissions to focus on his designs for the church known as the Sagrada Família.
Gaudí often collaborated with several other Catalan designers, industrialists, artists, and craftsmen on his projects, most prominently Josep María Jujol, who was often responsible for the broken tilework (trencadís) that is common to much of Gaudí's buildings. This helps to explain why Gaudí's structures often feature such a wide variety of materials, used in inventive and clever ways","Antoni Gaudí, the most renowned architect of Catalan Modernisme, revolutionized architecture with his innovative structures, integrating parabolic, hyperbolic, and catenary forms with religious and natural imagery. His deeply personal and devout Catholicism influenced his work, culminating in the Sagrada Família church. Collaborating with artists like Josep María Jujol, Gaudí's use of diverse materials, including trencadís tilework, made his designs both idiosyncratic and iconic, synonymous with Catalonia's identity."
"Paul Klee, (born December 18, 1879, Münchenbuchsee, near Bern, Switzerland—died June 29, 1940, Muralto, near Locarno), Swiss-German painter and draftsman who was one of the foremost artists of the 20th century.

Early life and education
Klee’s mother, née Ida Maria Frick of Basel, and his German-born father, Hans Klee, were both trained as musicians. By Swiss law, Paul Klee held his father’s nationality; late in life he applied for Swiss citizenship but died just days before it was granted. A gifted violinist, he briefly considered music as a career, and between 1903 and 1906 he played occasionally in the Bern symphony orchestra. Klee was educated in the classical Literarschule (a literary secondary school) in Bern. As a youth, he wrote poetry and even tried his hand at writing plays. The diaries he kept from 1897 to 1918 are valuable documents rich with detailed accounts of his experiences and his observations on art and literature.

As a boy, Klee did delicate landscape drawings, in which he and his parents saw the promise of a career, and he filled his school notebooks with comic sketches. Upon graduating from the Literarschule in 1898 he left for Munich, which was then the artistic capital of Germany, and enrolled in the private art school of Heinrich Knirr. In 1899 he was admitted to the Munich Academy, which was then under the direction of Franz von Stuck, the foremost painter of Munich. Stuck was a rather strict academic painter of allegorical pictures, but his emphasis on imagination proved invaluable to the young Klee.

Klee completed his artistic education with a six-month visit to Italy before returning to Bern. The beauty of the art of ancient Rome and of the Renaissance led him to question the imitative styles of his teachers and of his own previous work. Giving vent to his generally sardonic attitude toward people and institutions, Klee fell back on his undisputed talent for caricature, making it one of the cornerstones of his art. His first important works, a series of etchings, Inventions, undertaken in 1903–05 after his return from Italy and drawn in a tight technique inspired by Renaissance prints, are grotesque allegories of social pretension, artistic triumph and failure, and the nature and perils of woman.

Who Painted the Most Expensive Paintings in the World?
In 1906 Klee married Lily Stumpf, a pianist whom he had met while an art student, and that year he settled in Munich to pursue his career. His public debut that year—an exhibition of Inventions in Frankfurt am Main and Munich—was largely ignored. He tried to earn a living by writing reviews of art exhibits and concerts, teaching life-drawing classes, and providing illustrations for journals and books. He had one small success as an illustrator: the drawings he did in 1911–12 for Voltaire’s satirical novel Candide. Among his most-accomplished early works, these drawings attempt to capture the humour and universality of Voltaire’s satire by reducing characters, settings, and details to comic flurries of lines. As for Klee’s caricatures, they were rejected as too idiosyncratic, and for many years Klee’s small family—increased to three in 1907 by the birth of their only child, Felix—was supported largely by Lily’s piano lessons.

Over the next several years Klee began to address his relative ignorance of modern French art. In 1905 he visited Paris, where he took special note of the Impressionists, and between 1906 and 1909 he became successively acquainted with the work of the Post-Impressionists Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne and of the Belgian artist James Ensor. He also began to explore the expressive possibilities of children’s drawings. These varied influences imparted to his work a freedom of expression and a willfulness of style equaled by few other artists of the time.

Klee caught up with the avant-garde in 1911, when he entered the circle of Der Blaue Reiter, an artists’ organization founded in Munich that year by the Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky and the German painter Franz Marc. Kandinsky was then in the process of formulating his influential theory of abstract art as spiritual expression, and while Klee had only limited tolerance for his mysticism, the Russian artist, together with Marc, showed him how far abstraction and a visionary approach to content could be taken. Klee also came to know a wide variety of French Cubist painting from Der Blaue Reiter exhibitions of 1911–12 and from a visit he made to Paris in April 1912. He was especially impressed with the Orphic Cubism of the French artist Robert Delaunay.

Klee’s own adoption of the abstracted geometric style of the Cubists is seen in a number of drawings he did in 1912–13 that range from comic images of lust and mayhem to symbolic representations of fate. They are not as complex as Cubist compositions—that would come later, after Klee had assimilated his new discovery—but instead resemble, and were largely inspired by, the simple patterns of children’s drawings. Klee joined Cubism to children’s art because both, he believed, returned art to its fundamentals: children’s art by its direct and naive renderings, and Cubism by its timeless geometry. Together with Klee’s taste for caricature, these elements result in a characteristic union of the farcical and the sublime, two seemingly contradictory qualities held in suspension by Klee’s rigorous compositions and later by the beauty of his colour. From Cubism Klee also derived the frequent use of letters and other signs in his works: in Cubism these are usually simple indicators of the objects represented, but with Klee they become objects in their own right, imbuing his scenes with portents and enigmatic significance. ","
Swiss-German artist Paul Klee, renowned for his significant 20th-century art, had musician parents and initially explored a career in music. Educated in Munich, Klee's artistic journey was influenced by Renaissance art, leading to his unique style blending caricature, grotesque allegories, and satire. After marrying pianist Lily Stumpf and struggling for recognition, Klee's exposure to modern French art, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and his involvement with Der Blaue Reiter group greatly shaped his distinctive abstract style, characterized by geometric forms, symbolic representation, and integration of children's art and Cubism."

For many outsiders, Switzerland also evokes a prosperous if rather staid and unexciting society, an image that is now dated. Switzerland remains wealthy and orderly, but its mountain-walled valleys are far more likely to echo the music of a local rock band than a yodel or an alphorn. Most Swiss live in towns and cities, not in the idyllic rural landscapes that captivated the world through Johanna Spyri’s Heidi (1880–81), the country’s best-known literary work. Switzerland’s cities have emerged as international centres of industry and commerce connected to the larger world, a very different tenor from Switzerland’s isolated, more inward-looking past. As a consequence of its remarkably long-lived stability and carefully guarded neutrality, Switzerland—Geneva, in particular—has been selected as headquarters for a wide array of governmental and nongovernmental organizations, including many associated with the United Nations (UN)—an organization the Swiss resisted joining until the early 21st century.

Switzerland’s rugged topography and multicultural milieu have tended to emphasize difference. People living in close proximity may speak markedly distinct, sometimes nearly mutually unintelligible dialects of their first language, if not a different language altogether. German, French, Italian, and Romansh all enjoy national status, and English is spoken widely. Invisible lines separate historically Protestant from historically Roman Catholic districts, while the tall mountains of the St. Gotthard Pass separate northern from southern Europe and their diverse sensibilities and habits. Yet, Switzerland has forged strength from all these differences, creating a peaceful society in which individual rights are carefully balanced against community and national interests.

Switzerland was formed in 1291 by an alliance of cantons against the Habsburg dynasty—the Confoederatio Helvetica (or Swiss Confederation), from which the abbreviation CH for Switzerland derives—though only in 1848, when a new constitution was adopted, was the present nation formed. Prior to 1848, internal conflict was quite common, but Switzerland has enjoyed relative domestic tranquility since the mid-19th century, and its organization has remained essentially the same: it is a union of more than 3,000 communes, or municipalities, situated in 26 cantons, 6 of which are traditionally referred to as demicantons (half cantons) but function as full cantons. Ordinary citizens are able to participate at every level of politics and regularly exercise their will in referenda and initiatives, through which Swiss citizens directly make numerous policy decisions at the national and subnational level. Two effects of this popular involvement are evident: Swiss taxes are rather low by European standards, because voters are able to review and approve a broad range of expenditures, and political decision making tends to be slow, because contending individual claims and opinions must be allowed to be expressed at every step.

That high level of citizen involvement prompted the renowned 20th-century Swiss playwright and ironist Friedrich Dürrenmatt to allegorize Switzerland as a prison in which each Swiss citizen was at the same time prisoner and guard. Even so, the Swiss blend of federalism and direct democracy is unique in the world and is considered central to the country’s political and economic success. And Switzerland is indeed a major economic power, thanks to its long tradition of financial services and high-quality, specialized manufactures of items such as precision timepieces, optics, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, as well as of specialty foodstuffs such as Emmentaler cheese and milk chocolate. Switzerland is regularly judged to have among the world’s highest standards of living.","
Switzerland, a landlocked central European country, is known for its stunning Alpine scenery, vibrant cities blending old and new, and diverse cultural geography. Though small in size, it plays a significant role internationally, hosting numerous governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Multilingual and multicultural, it balances community interests with individual rights, maintaining peace and stability since the mid-19th century. Its direct democracy and federalism are unique, contributing to its economic success in finance, high-quality manufacturing, and renowned food products like cheese and chocolate, leading to high living standards."
"Wind systems
Prevailing winds are mainly from the west, but in valleys air currents are channeled into particularly frequent or violent local winds such as the Bise, a cold northeast wind that sweeps across the Mittelland and funnels down Lake Geneva to the city of Geneva. Foehn (German: Föhn) winds, which are associated with the leading edge of a low-pressure system moving across Europe north of Switzerland, often blow for one or two days; though they may occur anytime during the year, they are most frequent in spring. Sudden temperature increases occur because the foehn, which crosses the Alps from south to north (it can also blow from north to south, affecting Ticino), cools at a slower rate rising over the mountains because of precipitation; it is then heated and dried as it descends down the northern valleys, thereby moderating the climate on the northern slopes of the Alps.

Precipitation
Sankt Gallen
Sankt Gallen
Farms near Furkels, Sankt Gallen canton, Switzerland.
Since rainfall tends to increase in direct proportion to altitude, precipitation varies according to relief. Thus, because of the marked variation in relief that characterizes Switzerland, differences in precipitation within short linear distances are often very great. For example, Sankt Gallen (St. Gall), at 2,556 feet (779 metres), has an average annual precipitation of about 50 inches (1,300 mm), while precipitation at Säntis, at an elevation of 8,202 feet (2,500 metres) but only some 12 miles (20 km) away, is more than 110 inches (2,800 mm). The average annual precipitation of three-fourths of the country exceeds 40 inches (1,000 mm), varying amounts of which fall as snow. In Lugano (at 896 feet [273 metres]), which is located in the canton of Ticino in the southeast and has a modified Mediterranean climate, little precipitation is in the form of snow; in Zürich (at 1,824 feet [556 metres]) about one-tenth is snow; and on the Säntis nearly three-fourths is snow. At elevations above 11,500 feet (3,500 metres), all precipitation is in the form of snow, which compacts into perpetual snowfields and glaciers; the snow line is at about 9,200 feet (2,800 metres) in the northern Alps and about 10,800 feet (3,300 metres) in the southern Alps of the Valais.

Dry areas

There are distinct dry pockets in the mountains of Switzerland’s interior. The best-known dry area is the Rhône valley in the Valais, which is closely encircled by the highest (13,000 feet [4,000 metres]) mountain groups. Although precipitation is slight on the slopes near the cantonal capital of Sion (at 1,581 feet [482 metres]), extensive irrigation is possible, since the valley is surrounded by large snowfields and by glaciers that extend down the upper valleys. The rarefied and dry though somewhat polluted air of such high-altitude towns as Davos (5,216 feet [1,590 metres]) and Arosa (5,987 feet [1,825 metres]) permits a more intense, broader-spectrum solar irradiation and thus produces a climate famous in the past for tuberculosis cures. Today the climate attracts skiers as well as tourists seeking an escape from the polluted air of lowland Europe. At elevations of 13,000 feet (4,000 metres), precipitation levels rise to some 160 inches (4,000 mm), and the Mönch (13,448 feet [4,099 metres]) in the Jungfrau group of mountains has the highest average annual precipitation in Switzerland, 163 inches (4,140 mm), while Stalden in the entrenched Vispa valley, 4 miles (6 km) south of the main Rhône valley, has the lowest, 21 inches (533 mm).

The stable high-pressure weather conditions prevailing over central Europe and the Alps during autumn and winter create cold air masses that result in lowland fog, a climatic phenomenon with widely varying consequences. The mouths of the northern Alpine valleys, the basins of the Jura Mountains, and the villages and cities of the low areas of the Mittelland are blanketed for days and often for weeks on end, while towns located at higher altitudes enjoy warm, brilliant, high-pressure conditions and the view of the glistening sea of fog below them. Temperature inversions between mountain and valley locations in close proximity can be quite pronounced, with higher elevations having higher temperature readings. Frequent temperature inversion has made Switzerland’s high-altitude resorts healthful places even during winter and has helped the Alpine winter season gain popularity in Europe for sports; in addition, because of these inversions polluted air is much less common in areas of high elevation than in the lowlands. In fact, the temperature inversions that affect the Mittelland tend to trap polluted air for weeks when cyclonic activity stagnates.

Avalanches
With the increase in winter tourism, the study of avalanches has developed as a branch of Alpine climatology, and in wintertime the research station near Davos releases daily avalanche bulletins as a warning for villagers and tourists. The Alpine cantons have about 10,000 avalanches annually, with about four-fifths of them occurring in February, March, and April. For centuries, village communes have relied on forests on the mountain slopes for protection from these slides, because a 20- to 30-year-old forest can inhibit or stop small avalanches. Villages, highways, and Alpine paths are also protected by costly artificial structures such as metal barriers, earthen walls, and concrete wedges and enclosures. However, in the late 20th century, acid rain caused the illness and death of many trees in the mountain areas of Switzerland and posed a serious threat to their ability to act as barriers to avalanches. In the mountain forests, some two-fifths of the trees were classified as damaged, sick, or dying. Pollution-control legislation across Europe did much to reduce the harmful effects of acid rain in Switzerland, and a concerted effort was made by Swiss land managers to introduce healthy trees into unused Alpine pastureland and to increase the density of existing Alpine forests. By the early 21st century, avalanche-control forests had become healthier and denser, especially at higher elevations and in steeper terrain.","
Switzerland experiences diverse wind systems, including the cold Bise and warm Foehn, impacting its climate. Varied topography leads to significant precipitation differences, with higher altitudes receiving more, often as snow. Dry areas exist, notably the Rhône valley in Valais, benefiting from irrigation. High-altitude towns like Davos offer a pollution-free environment, attracting tourists and skiers. Temperature inversions trap pollution in lowlands but create clear skies in higher regions. Avalanches are frequent, with protective measures including forests and artificial barriers, although acid rain has impacted forest health, necessitating conservation efforts."
"French language, probably the most internationally significant Romance language in the world.

At the beginning of the 21st century, French was an official language of more than 25 countries. In France and Corsica about 60 million individuals use it as their first language, in Canada more than 7.3 million, in Belgium more than 3.9 million, in Switzerland (cantons of Neuchâtel, Vaud, Genève, Valais, Fribourg) more than 1.8 million, in Monaco some 80,000, in Italy some 100,000, and in the United States (especially Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont) some 1.3 million. Furthermore, more than 49 million Africans—in such countries as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Kinshasa), Côte d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo, and Tunisia—use French as a first or second language, and millions of inhabitants of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia use it as their principal international language. Many creole French speakers too use standard French in formal situations.

History
The first document apparently written in French probably dates from 842. Known as the Strasbourg Oaths, it is a Romance version of oaths sworn by two of Charlemagne’s grandsons. Some claim that the text of that document is thinly disguised Latin constructed after the event to look authentic for political propaganda purposes, while others suppose that its Latinizing tendencies reveal the struggle of the scribe with the problems of spelling French as it was spoken at the time. If the language of the Strasbourg Oaths is northern French, it is difficult to ascertain what dialect it represents; some say that of Picard, the dialect of Picardy, others Franco-Provençal, and so on.

The second existing text in Old French (with Picard and Walloon features) is a rendering of a short sequence by Prudentius on the life of St. Eulalia, precisely dated 880–882 CE. Two 10th-century texts (the Passion du Christ and the Vie de St. Léger) seem to mingle northern and southern dialect features, while another (the “Jonas fragment”) is obviously from the far north. In the 12th century the “gem” of the epic poems known as chansons de geste, La Chanson de Roland, was written. One of the most beautiful poems of its type in world literature, it evinces certain dialectal characteristics the origins of which are difficult to establish. In the 12th–13th century the Francien dialect became dominant, and it gained the status of literary language because of both the central position of the Île-de-France region and the political and cultural prestige of Paris.

The Francien dialect was basically a north-central dialect with some northern features. Before that, other dialects, especially Norman (which developed in Britain as Anglo-Norman, widely used until the 14th century) and northern dialects (such as Picard), had more prestige, especially in the literary sphere (see Anglo-Norman literature).

The legal reform known as the Edict of Villers-Cotterêts (1539), however, established Francien as the only official language (as opposed to both Latin and other dialects) after it proved to be the most popular written form. From then on, standard French began to replace local dialects, which were officially discouraged, though the standard language did not spread to popular usage in all regions until well into the 19th century. Dialectal features, which were still admired and cherished by 16th-century writers, were ridiculed in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the grammar and vocabulary of the modern language were standardized and polished to an unprecedented degree.

Francien has largely replaced other regional dialects of French spoken in northern and central France; those dialects made up the so-called langue d’oïl (the term is based on the French use of the word oïl, modern oui, for “yes”). Standard French has also greatly reduced the use of the Occitan language of southern France (the so-called langue d’oc, from Provençal oc for “yes”). Provençal, Occitan’s major dialect, was a widely used medieval literary language.

Characteristics

French phonology is characterized by great changes in the sounds of words as compared with their Latin parent forms as well as cognates in the other Romance languages. For example, Latin secūrum ‘sure, secure’ became Spanish seguro but French sûr; Latin vōcem ‘voice’ became Spanish voz but French voix, pronounced vwa.

French grammar, like that of the other Romance languages, has been greatly simplified from that of Latin. Nouns are not declined for case. Formerly, they were marked for plural by the addition of -s or -es, but the ending, though retained in spelling, has generally been lost in speech. Masculine and feminine gender are distinguished but are usually marked not in the noun but rather in the accompanying article or adjective. Plural marking in spoken French is often similarly distinguished. The verb in French is conjugated for three persons, singular and plural, but again, although distinguished in spelling, several of these forms are pronounced identically. French has verb forms for indicative, imperative, and subjunctive moods; preterite, imperfect, present, future, and conditional, and a variety of perfect and progressive tenses; and passive and reflexive constructions.

Linguistic change was more rapid and more drastic in northern France than it was in other European Romance regions, and influence from Latin was comparatively slight (though borrowing of Latin vocabulary has been great since the 14th century). The influence of the Germanic Frankish invaders is often held to account for exotic features in Old French, such as strong stress accent and abundant use of diphthongs and nasal vowels, but by the 15th century the language had begun to change, and a sober (even monotonous) intonation and loss of a stress accent became characteristic. The popularity of French as a first foreign language, in spite of numerous pronunciation difficulties for nearly all foreign speakers, is perhaps as much the result of the precise codification of its grammar, effectuated especially during the 18th century, as of the brilliance of its literature at all periods.

Modern dialects are classified mainly on a geographic basis, and most survive only in rural areas. Walloon, spoken mainly in Belgium, is something of an exception in that it has had a flourishing dialect literature since approximately 1600. Other dialects are grouped as follows:

Central: Francien, Orléanais, Bourbonnais, Champenois
Northern: Picard, Northern Norman
Eastern: Lorrain, Bourguignon (Burgundian), Franc-Comtois
Western: Norman, Gallo (around the Celtic Breton area), Angevin, Manceau
Southwestern: Poitevin, Saintongeais, Angoumois
Canadian French

Outside France, the French of Canada, originally probably of northwestern dialect type, has developed the most individual features. Although 18th-century Canadian French was regarded as exceptionally “pure” by metropolitan commentators, it began to diverge from Parisian French after 1760 as a consequence of its isolation from the metropolis and of the ever-stronger influence of English. Canadian French is less clearly articulated, with less lip movement and with a more monotonous intonation, than standard French; some change in consonantal sounds occurs (/t/ and /d/ shift to /ts/ and /dz/, respectively, and both k and g become palatalized [pronounced with the tongue touching the hard palate, or roof of the mouth] when followed by the letters i or e); nasal vowels tend to lose the nasal element; vocabulary and syntax are heavily Anglicized.

Although intellectuals turn toward France for cultural inspiration, the pronunciation and usage of standard French is sometimes derided by French Canadians; this may be because their English compatriots are taught Parisian French at school. The French-speaking population of Canada is growing relatively fast, and more than four-fifths of the population of Quebec province uses French on a daily basis. The continuing activities of the separatist movement provide evidence of the persistence of resentment among many French Canadians. ","
French is a globally significant Romance language, spoken as a first language by millions in France, Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, and the United States. Additionally, over 49 million Africans and residents of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia use it as a first or second language. French has a rich history, with dialectal variations, and it evolved from Latin. Modern French is characterized by simplified grammar, gendered articles, and a variety of verb forms. Dialects persist mainly in rural areas. Canadian French has unique features and has been influenced by English. The language remains a cultural and political topic in Canada, especially in Quebec."

Édouard Glissant, (born September 21, 1928, Le Lamentin, Martinique—died February 3, 2011, Paris, France), French-speaking West Indian poet and novelist who belonged to the literary Africanism movement.

Glissant was a disciple and fellow countryman of the poet Aimé Césaire, who founded the Negritude movement to promote an African culture free of all colonial influences. Glissant recorded the awakening of colonized peoples in his verse collection Un Champ d’îles (1953; “An Expanse of Islands”) and in his epic poem Les Indes (1956; The Indies in bilingual edition). His novel La Lézarde (1958; “The Crack”; Eng. trans. The Ripening) won him France’s Prix Théophraste Renaudot (1958), an important annual award bestowed upon a novel. In Le Quatrième Siècle (1964; “The Fourth Century”), he retraced the history of slavery in Martinique and the rise of a generation of young West Indians, trained in European universities, who would reclaim their land. The narrative structure of his novel Malemort (1975) interweaves the colonial history of Martinique with an examination of contemporary experience, a technique he used again in La Case du commandeur (1981; “The Commander’s Cabin”). Glissant’s other verse collections include Boises (1977; “Woods”) and Pays rêvé, pays réel (1985; “Countries Dreamed, Countries Real”). The collection of poems Le Sel noir (1960) was published in English translation as Black Salt: Poems. Glissant’s play Monsieur Toussaint (published 1961) is about the Haitian hero Toussaint-Louverture. His book about William Faulkner, Faulkner, Mississippi (1996), appeared in English translation under the same title.  ","Édouard Glissant (1928–2011) was a Martinican author associated with the Negritude movement. He was influenced by Aimé Césaire and focused on promoting African culture free from colonial influences.

"Summary of Paul Strand
The history of modern art shows that America offered a fertile environment for some of the most important photographic pioneers of the twentieth century. It was perhaps Paul Strand who carved out a most unique position amongst them. Strand is often discussed as the architect of the so-called Straight Photography; a pure photographic style that utilized large format cameras to record, and bring new perspectives to ordinary or previously ignored subjects in the name of fine art. Strand's 'Straight' aesthetic proved so persuasive in fact that it was adopted by other luminaries in the photographic circle and the 'Straight' ideal formed part of the clarion call for the famous f/64 Group who shared similar ideals with Strand, as did a number of other Straight photographers in the next several decades. Yet Strand was to push forward by extending the 'Straight' aesthetic to the field of documentary and he became highly regarded, and something of a standard-bearer, for those in pursuit of social and political redress through both the still and moving image.

Accomplishments
Strand had come to the view that photographic art should amount to more than 'false' figurative pictures set in idealized settings; this practice, known as Pictorialism, was reviled by modernists. He recognized that the camera held a patent advantage over other plastic arts in that it could freeze a moment in time and space in a way that was impossible to replicate by hand or in real time. His Straight Photography offered then the most unadulterated route to a purer, deeper photographic experience.
Taking inspiration from the formalist, or cubist, paintings of Cézanne, Braque, and Picasso, Strand became fixated on the idea that the photographic image could also be broken up compositionally. Straight Photography used large format cameras to create high contrasts (over shading), flat (or two dimensional) images, semi-abstractions and/or geometric repetitions. The images were reliant on size and context for their full affect and were thus often intended to be hung on the hallowed white walls of dedicated photographic galleries.
Unlike others in his artistic circle who were fully invested in the 'art-for-art's-sake' doctrine, Strand's worldview accommodated the idea that art should be able to engage the spectator spiritually and socially. He is thus associated with the idea that high art can (should indeed) accommodate abstraction and realism simultaneously; that is - in the same photograph or the same documentary film.

Wall Street (1915)
Artwork Images
1915
Wall Street
Wall Street is an historically significant image, both for Strand and for the development of photographic art. It marked a clear departure from a style of soft-focused Pictorialism (practiced hitherto by Strand) whereby the photographer used a camera and dark-room manipulation to produce images that mimicked that rather unfashionable (by modernism's standards) painting style. The image provides an early example of Strand's willingness to accommodate documentary realism and abstraction within the same frame. On the one hand, Strand offers the spectator an objective, 'straight', record of a street scene showing walking pedestrians as the sun elongates their shadows; on the other, we have a high contrast interplay of light and dark as the shadows formed by the niches of the large Morgan Trust Bank building produce a slanting geometric pattern.

Unlike his contemporaries, such as Alvin Langdon Coburn and Karl Struss who emphasized activity and movement in their urban images, Strand's approach was more deliberate and as such he typically focused his images on slower movements and static scenes. Indeed, with Wall Street in particular, Strand was shocked that he was able to get such a sharp image of the moving people considering how slow the plates took to process. It is said that Edward Hopper became fascinated with this image, and adopted some of the same formal techniques for his own paintings.

Porch Shadows (1916)

Porch Shadows
During the summer of 1916, Strand vacationed at a rented cottage in Twin Lakes, Connecticut. Inspired by the European avant-gardes, and the Cubists especially, he had already reached the conclusion that ""All good art is abstract in its structure"" and he began to explore the question, posed by the European painters, of ""what a picture consists of, how shapes are related to each other, [and] how spaces are filled"". Using everyday items, including kitchen furniture and crockery, and fruit, Strand used his large plate camera to transform - or elevate - the mundane utilities into pure two-dimensional patterns. The resulting collection did in fact include some of the very first purely abstracted photographic images. Porch Shadows exemplifies this way of working. On close inspection, we might deduce that the object in question is no more than an ordinary round table placed on a terrace porch. But Strand alters our perception by firstly rotating the image. The geometric shapes meanwhile - thin stripes, parallelograms and a large triangle - are created in the shadows and light brought to the composition by the strong sun as it penetrates the slats of the terrace window.

Blind Woman, New York (1916)
1916
Blind Woman, New York
Strand believed that the furtive nature of authentic urban portraiture was both vital and morally justifiable: ""I was attempting to give something to the world and not exploit anyone in the process"" he said. This early portrait, first published in Camera Work, was taken in Five Points, the heart of the immigrant slums on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and is indicative of Strand's socialist and artistic mission. It shows a desolate woman in medium close shot. Around her neck hangs a hand-painted sign that alerts us to the fact that she is ""BLIND"", and above which, a numbered badge pinned to her black smock identifies her as a licensed newspaper vendor. Her attention is drawn to an event outside the frame, and though she is blind, the photograph confirms that she is oblivious to the camera's close proximity. Indeed, in order to achieve portraits of such arresting quality Strand devised a strategy whereby he rigged his camera with a false lens that pointed forward, while the working lens was actually placed at a ninety-degree angle and hidden from the subject's view under his arm.

In his influential book The Ongoing Moment in which he looked at photographic trends, Geoff Dyer suggested that the blind women's off-centre pupils reflected Strand's own skewed lens set up and that, moreover, the blind subject was more generally ""the objective corollary of the photographer's [own] longed-for invisibility"". In any case, practical and moral complications notwithstanding, Strand maintained that the task of portraiture was to ""almost bring the presence of that person photographed to other people"" and that, though the 'ordinary' subject has been all but anonymous till now, the spectator is ""confronted with a human being that they won't forget"". This photograph ""immediately became an icon of the new American photography, which integrated the humanism of social documentation with the boldly simplified forms of modernism"" according to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.","Paul Strand was a pioneering American photographer known for his contributions to Straight Photography. He embraced a style that used large format cameras to capture ordinary subjects with a focus on fine art. Strand's work combined elements of abstraction and realism, influenced by artists like Cézanne, Braque, and Picasso. His notable works include ""Wall Street,"" which blended documentary realism with abstraction, and ""Blind Woman, New York,"" a socially impactful portrait. Strand's innovative approach left a lasting impact on modern photography, bridging the gap between art and social commentary.

"t about 3 million square miles (7.7 million square km), Australia is the smallest continent on Earth. In fact, it’s closer in size to Greenland than it is to South America. Does that make Australia an island like Greenland?

Although Australia is sometimes called an “island continent,” most geographers consider islands and continents to be separate things. According to Britannica, an island is a mass of land that is both “entirely surrounded by water” and also “smaller than a continent.” By that definition, Australia can’t be an island because it’s already a continent.

But in that case, what’s the difference between Australia and Greenland? Why isn’t Greenland (at 836,000 square miles [2,165,230 square km]) considered a continent instead of just the world’s largest island? Unfortunately, there isn’t a strict scientific definition of a continent. But there are a few criteria that are commonly used to distinguish one continent from another.

First, there is a geological distinction. While Australia and most of Asia are situated on separate tectonic plates, Greenland shares a tectonic plate with North America. Second, there is a biological distinction. While a large percentage of Australia’s plant and animal species can be found nowhere else in the world, fewer of Greenland’s species are unique. Third, there is an anthropological distinction. Aboriginal people are limited to Australia, while indigenous Greenlanders belong to a group of peoples (the Inuit) found throughout the Arctic, including parts of Canada, the United States, and Russia.

While each of those criteria may not be sufficient on its own—for instance, Europe and Asia also share a tectonic plate but are usually considered separate continents for cultural reasons—together they form a general understanding of what qualifies as a continent.

Of course, there’s also the basic matter of size. Australia is nearly four times as large as Greenland. If they were much closer in area, Greenland might have more of a case for continent status (and Australia for island status). As it is, the vast difference between the two makes for a good dividing line","Australia, often referred to as an ""island continent,"" is distinct from islands due to its size and geological, biological, and anthropological factors. While there's no strict scientific definition of a continent, common criteria distinguish it from islands. Australia's geological separation, unique species, and Aboriginal population set it apart. In contrast, Greenland, despite its size, shares a tectonic plate with North America and has fewer unique species. Size also plays a role, as Australia is much larger than Greenland, further solidifying its continent status. These criteria collectively help define what qualifies as a continent."
"hich Is Correct: Hanukkah or Chanukah?

The Jewish Festival of Lights is an eight-day celebration that commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem. It is one of the most popular holidays in Judaism and is marked by the lighting of the menorah. For many English speakers, the festival is also known for confusion over the spelling of its name: Is it Hanukkah or Chanukah? The answer is that both are considered correct, though Hanukkah is the most widely used spelling, while Chanukah is more traditional. In addition, more than 20 other variations are recorded. Why so many spellings? Transliteration.

Hebrew does not use the Latin alphabet, which is the standard script of many languages, including English. Thus, when used in an English context, the sounds of the different Hebrew characters must be converted, or transliterated, into Latin letters. However, the Hebrew word for the holiday uses sounds that aren’t found in the Latin alphabet. The difficulty begins with the very first letter of the word, which is the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet—ḥet, or chet. It is pronounced with a guttural sound that is similar to the /ch/ in loch. So, when the Hebrew word was transliterated in the 17th century, the ḥet became ch (Chanukah). However, when the English ch appears at the beginning of a word, it sounds quite different than the Hebrew ḥet (compare loch and chair). Thus, in the 18th century another spelling appeared—Hanukkah—even though the h doesn’t really sound like ḥet either. Transliteration issues also arose over the use of other letters—such as one or two k’s—resulting in many spelling variations.","Both ""Hanukkah"" and ""Chanukah"" are considered correct spellings for the Jewish Festival of Lights, with ""Hanukkah"" being more widely used and ""Chanukah"" being more traditional. The variations in spelling are due to transliteration challenges since Hebrew characters don't directly match Latin letters. The initial letter, ""ḥet,"" is pronounced like the guttural sound in ""loch."" In the 17th century, it was transliterated as ""ch"" (Chanukah), and in the 18th century, ""Hanukkah"" emerged. Other spelling variations exist, reflecting challenges in converting Hebrew sounds to Latin letters.

"Was Napoleon Short?

At the beginning of the 19th century, Charles IV, king of Spain, commissioned the preeminent artist Jacques-Louis David to commemorate Napoleon’s successful campaign against Austria at the Battle of Marengo with a painting. David’s finished work, Napoleon Crossing the Alps (1801), portrays the general sitting astride a rearing stallion on a rocky cliff. His hair and cape billow theatrically in the wind as he sternly gazes at the viewer and gestures toward the summit, apparently summoning his troops. When Napoleon saw the dashing portrait, he was flattered and commissioned David to paint three more just like it. Napoleon was no stranger to propaganda. He knew the importance of shaping, if not magnifying, his reputation, and among his efforts were censoring the French press when he was emperor and dictating his life story during his exile. Yet, there was one particularly pesky aspect of his legacy that Napoleon could not control: word that he was short. The rumor was rampant during his lifetime and persisted centuries after his death. In the 21st century, people may not be able to say exactly why Napoleon was so important, but they can usually say that he was short. Alas, the one thing everyone remembers about Napoleon probably isn’t even true!

Napoleon was called Le Petit Caporal, but the nickname, translated as “The Little Corporal,” was not meant as a reflection of his stature. It was intended as a term of affection by his soldiers. Indeed, many contemporary French paintings, including David’s equestrian portrait, suggest that the general was not short but of average stature. In that painting he at least seems to be in proportion to his horse—but there are no other human figures nearby to which the viewer can refer. David’s other portraits of Napoleon don’t offer much by way of comparison either: in the majestic Consecration of the Emperor Napoleon and the Coronation of Empress Joséphine on December 2, 1804 (1806–07), the stepped platform from which Napoleon crowns his wife challenges any comparison with other figures, while The Emperor Napoleon in His Study at the Tuileries (1812) represents the subject standing alone at a desk. Works by contemporary artists show him similarly alone or sitting. One work by David’s student, Antoine-Jean Gros, however, offers a group of figures on the same plane with which to compare the general. Napoleon Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Stricken in Jaffa, March 11, 1799 (1804), commissioned by Napoleon, represents an episode from his Egyptian campaign in which he visited his plague-stricken troops in a makeshift hospital. By touching one of the victims, Napoleon defies the men around him, who hold handkerchiefs to their faces. He appears not only heroic but also average! All the men standing near him seem to be about the same height.

How did Napoleon become a legend? (Napoleon I, Napoleon Bonaparte, Napoleonic Code, emperor of France, Josephine). Napoleon I, French in full Napoleon Bonaparte, original Italian Napoleone Buonaparte, byname the Corsican or the Little Corporal, French byname Le Corse or Le Petit Caporal, (born August 15, 1769, Ajaccio, Corsica-died May 5, 1821, St. Helena Island), French general, first consul (1799-1804), and emperor of the French (1804-1814/15), one of the most celebrated personages in the history of the West.
Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.
The English, however, were not so generous: their artists depicted Napoleon as diminutive. Around 1803 the celebrated cartoonist James Gillray introduced the character of “Little Boney,” who resembled a childish Napoleon. At first, Gillray seemingly emphasized brattiness: in “Maniac ravings—or—Little Boney in a Strong fit,” Napoleon is shown in the midst of a tantrum, flipping furniture, wailing about the “British Nation” and “London Newspapers,” and shouting “Oh Oh Oh. Revenge! Revenge!” Gillray then played up juvenility through smallness, whereby Napoleon was represented wearing huge boots and, as one source put it, “trying to talk tough beneath an enormous bicorne hat dwarfing his entire body. Or struggling to pull a sword from an unwieldy scabbard that dragged along the ground as he walked.” Soon Napoleon was just depicted as being short. In “The Empress’s wish or Boney Puzzled!!” another cartoonist, Isaac Cruikshank, depicted a peevish Napoleon at about half the height of his wife and troops. A wee Bonaparte thus became the standard for representing the emperor in English newspapers.

Though it’s hard to say if and why the British invented the short Napoleon trope, there is some truth in Cruikshank’s representation: Napoleon was probably significantly shorter than his troops. Several sources note that his elite guards were taller than most Frenchmen, and thus Napoleon had the appearance of being shorter than he really was. Yet interpretations of Napoleon’s death certificate estimate that his height when he died was between 5’2” and 5’7” (1.58 and 1.7 meters). The discrepancy is often explained by the disparity between the 19th-century French inch, which was 2.71 cm, and the current inch measurement, which is 2.54 cm. Sources consequently estimate that Napoleon was probably closer to 5’6” or 5’7” (1.68 or 1.7 meters) than to 5’2”. Although the range may seem short by 21st-century standards, it was typical in the 19th century, when most Frenchmen stood between 5’2” and 5’6” (1.58 and 1.68 meters) tall. Napoleon was thus average or taller, no matter the interpretation.

Although Napoleon’s death certificate seems to suggest that he was probably taller than the typical 19th-century Frenchman, English cartoons, his nickname, and other hearsay left a lasting impression that the emperor was short. It was an impression that continued into the 21st century and one which no heroic painting by Jacques-Louis David could undo.  ","The notion that Napoleon Bonaparte was short is a widespread misconception. Although he was often nicknamed ""The Little Corporal,"" it was meant as a term of affection by his soldiers and didn't reflect his actual stature. While English cartoons portrayed him as short, historical estimates suggest he was likely between 5'6"" to 5'7"", which was average or even taller than the typical Frenchman of the 19th century. The misconception persisted due to caricatures and hearsay, despite evidence to the contrary. Napoleon's height was not a defining characteristic, and he was an influential historical figure.

"Cannibalism: Cultures, Cures, Cuisine, and Calories

Perhaps nothing inspires as much fascination and repulsion as human cannibalism. Although it is now regarded as one of society’s greatest taboos and is often associated with evil—think Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs (1991)—history reveals a practice that is more complex and, surprisingly, sometimes even reverential.

Funereal rituals involving cannibalism have been well documented. The Fore of Papua New Guinea, for example, were known to have eaten the bodies of their deceased. The practice was seen as a sign of love and respect, preventing corpses from rotting or being devoured by insects. In addition, the ritual was thought to protect the body from any dangerous spirits. The Wari of the Brazilian Amazon included cannibalism in their funereal rites into the 1960s, when missionaries precipitated the end of the practice. Also common were religious rituals that featured cannibalism. After making human sacrifices to the gods, the Aztecs reportedly ate the corpses, which they considered sacred.

Eating the body of an enemy was perhaps the ultimate act of revenge. In addition to showing domination and inspiring fear, consuming one’s foe was thought to enable the victor to possess the strength and bravery of the vanquished. Japanese soldiers during World War II consumed POWs, while the Korowai of New Guinea were within their rights to eat men thought to be witches. Ugandan leader Idi Amin, whose regime (1971–79) was noted for brutality, was accused of cannibalizing his opponents, and he responded with a nondenial: “I don’t like human flesh. It’s too salty for me.” The Carib of the Caribbean islands were also thought to have eaten their enemies, and Europeans used claims of cannibalism to justify the murder and enslavement of numerous indigenous people. Though the veracity of the allegations against the Carib is still debated, the term cannibalism derives from a corruption of their name.

Medicinal cannibalism seems to have existed around the world, with nearly every body part ending up in some concoction. Chinese compounds included human organs as well as nails and hair, while, in early Greece, human blood was thought to treat epilepsy. And even as they were decrying cannibals in the New World as savages, Europeans were routinely consuming human parts as medicinal treatment. Followers of 16th-century Swiss physician Paracelsus, for example, sought to cure dysentery with medicines that contained powdered human skulls, and in 17th-century England pulverized mummies were used in treatments for epilepsy and stomachaches. In some cases, not just any mummy would do: one concoction called for the body of a redheaded man who had died from hanging.

And then there is cannibal cuisine. (For the record, human flesh allegedly is similar in taste to veal or pork.) The Batak of Sumatra reportedly sold human flesh in markets, and in China human-based dishes were once considered a luxury. During the Yuan dynasty (13th–14th century), it was noted that “children’s meat was the best food of all in taste.” The country also reported cases of children cutting off various body parts—usually a section of the thigh or upper arm—to use in dishes for their elders as a show of respect.

Despite being relatively widespread—though some scholars believe that many reports of cannibalism are untrue—the practice eventually became taboo. However, there are some instances when it was accepted—or at least tolerated—and these cases typically involved survival. According to a recent study, the average human body contains more than 125,000 calories—a feast to anyone starving. One of the most famous examples of survival cannibalism involved the Donner party. In 1846, 87 pioneers led by George Donner left Independence, Missouri, bound for California. In December they became trapped by heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada. Facing starvation, the people eventually resorted to cannibalism. The story became well known—thanks in part to an eager press. (Somewhat ironically, in 2010 the media misinterpreted a study and suggested that cannibalism had not occurred within the Donner party.)

Another example of survival cannibalism followed a plane crash in the Andes Mountains in 1972. Of the 45 passengers—a number of whom belonged to a Uruguayan rugby team—only 16 survived the 72-day ordeal, which included cannibalism, an act some of those rescued later compared to taking Holy Communion. And at Jamestown Colony in 1609–10—a period known as the Starving Time—desperate American settlers cannibalized their neighbors after first eating rats and shoe leather","Human cannibalism, a practice that often evokes fascination and repulsion, has a complex history. It has been observed in various forms, including funerary rituals aimed at preserving the deceased, religious practices involving human sacrifices, and acts of revenge to gain strength from vanquished foes. Medicinal cannibalism was once common worldwide, with body parts used in concoctions for various ailments. Cannibal cuisine was also documented, with human flesh likened to veal or pork. In some cases, cannibalism was accepted as a means of survival, as seen in the Donner Party and Andes plane crash survivors.

"To early writers of Chicago’s history, John Kinzie, a white Protestant involved in trade and politics, was the embodiment of a founding father—so they designated him the city’s first citizen. Yet these writers overlooked Jean-Baptist-Point Du Sable, the man who is thought to have first occupied the area at the mouth of the Chicago River in the late 18th century. Du Sable built a cabin and a prosperous trading post that served Native Americans and European traders. Having been born in what is now Haiti to a French sailor and an enslaved woman of African descent, been married to a Potawatomi woman, and sold his property in 1800, Du Sable was unlike the typical founding father, and so he was largely left out of Chicago’s history. The city did not recognize Du Sable as its official founder until 2006.

In fairness, the first inhabitant of Chicago was neither Jean-Baptist-Point Du Sable nor John Kinzie—it was an as-yet-unknown Native American.  ","

The Mogao Caves, or Caves of the Thousand Buddhas, encapsulate a millennium of Buddhist history. The site, on the ancient Silk Route, is near the Dunhuang oasis, for centuries a popular resting place for travelers, traders, wandering monks, and pilgrims. These human-made caves date to the 4th century CE.

It was not only expensive luxury items that were transported via the extensive Silk Route. Buddhism, along with its art and architecture, also made its way from India to China as traders moved across the continent. The caves served as a shelter for travelers, as cells in which to meditate, and as artists’ galleries. The iconography of the art discovered inside the Mogao Caves was inspired by Indian Buddhism, but the stylistic elements were changed as the religion moved into a new artistic region.

The caves’ wealth of artistic treasures include murals, clay sculptures, and priceless manuscripts. The Buddhist community encouraged patronage of the arts, and the emperors of the Tang dynasty (618–907) gave specific financial support to the caves, encouraging artists to work here; two colossal Buddha statues and mural paintings can be dated from that period. As a result of state patronage, the paintings in the caves also depict secular subjects such as the military exploits of Chinese rulers.

Despite the threat posed by invaders, the caves’ cultural legacy has miraculously survived, thanks to monks who hid the manuscripts and Tibetans who protected the site. In 1907, Daoist priest Wang Yuanlu revealed to archeologist Sir Aurel Stein a previously hidden “library cave,” which had been sealed a thousand years before. It contained about a thousand well-preserved ancient manuscripts, silk banners, paintings, rare textiles, and secular documents—in total some 50,000 documents in Khotanese, Tibetan, Chinese, Sanskrit, and Uighur.

The Grotto of Massabielle—a simple, shallow cave—was made famous by St. Bernadette in the mid-19th century. Her visions of the Virgin Mary helped to turn the town of Lourdes in southwest France into a major pilgrimage center, attracting millions of visitors each year.

Marie-Bernadette Soubirous was a pious girl—the daughter of a penniless miller. In 1858, when she was just 14, she experienced a series of visions at the grotto. The Virgin spoke to Bernadette in the local dialect, instructing her to dig a hole in the ground. On doing so, the girl discovered a spring, which, she was told, could heal the sick. The church authorities questioned her closely, but they could not fault her account. As word of this apparent miracle spread, pilgrims and invalids began to flock to the site, seeking a remedy for their ailments. Bernadette retired to a convent where she spent the remainder of her short life, dying at the age of 35.

In 1862 the visions were officially acknowledged by the Roman Catholic Church, and the area developed rapidly in response to the burgeoning interest in the site. A statue of the Virgin, based on Bernadette’s description of the figure seen in her visions, was placed in the grotto in 1864. The Basilicas of the Immaculate Conception and Our Lady of the Rosary were erected for the huge influx of pilgrims, and the first national procession was staged in 1873.

The popularity of Lourdes continued unabated in the 20th century. Bernadette was canonized in 1933, albeit for her piety rather than her visions, and interest in her received fresh impetus from a film of her life. The Song of Bernadette (1943), which was an international success, earned the actress Jennifer Jones an Oscar and a Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of the saint. (Iain Zaczek)

In September 1940 four boys were playing in the woods near Montignac, France, when their dog disappeared down a hole. That hole turned out to be the entrance to a cave. Unwittingly, the friends had stumbled across Europe’s finest surviving collection of Paleolithic cave art. The cave at Lascaux is not unique—the Vézère valley alone contains 25 decorated caves—but the range and quality of the paintings are unparalleled.

Lascaux contains about 600 paintings and 1,500 engravings spread across a series of linked chambers. A high proportion of the images depict animals. The most spectacular examples are in the Great Hall of Bulls, which is dominated by four huge beasts measuring up to 18 feet (5.4 meters) long. The purpose of the paintings has been much debated. Many are in areas where they could never have been viewed properly, so their function seems to have been religious rather than decorative.

The cave was discovered during wartime, so a detailed examination of the site was delayed, but it was opened to the public in 1948. Record crowds came to see it—which rapidly became a problem. The humidity from the visitors’ breath, together with the dust and pollen on their shoes, caused a noticeable deterioration in the pictures. The cave was closed in 1963, and a facsimile was created inside a shell of reinforced concrete. Lascaux II opened in 1983 and has proved every bit as popular as the original.

Altamira, near Santillana del Mar, Spain, belongs to the Franco-Cantabrian belt of decorated caves, which extends from southwest France to northeast Spain. The cave itself had been found by a huntsman in 1868, but it was 11 years later that a five-year-old girl noticed the paintings. Her father, Marcelino de Sautuola, was the first to excavate the site and publish his findings. His claim that the paintings were Paleolithic was greeted with some skepticism. Some French archeologists even suggested that they were forgeries. Sautuola’s theories were eventually vindicated after his death.

The extraordinary paintings are mainly of animals. The finest ones depict bison, but deer, boars, and horses also appear. The artists used just three color pigments—ocher, red, and black—but managed to create remarkably realistic images, particularly in the texture of the manes and fur. The painters also used the uneven surface of the walls to give the animals a sense of volume. In common with the caves at Lascaux and elsewhere, conservation has been a major and ongoing headache. The cave was closed for a time in 1977 and then reopened five years later on a very limited basis. Prospective visitors are encouraged to visit one of the replicas of the cave. The first of these was produced by the Deutsches Museum in Munich (1962), but there is another version in Madrid (1964) and a more elaborate one near Altamira itself (2001). (Iain Zaczek)

A spectacular cave system near the Spanish town of Atapuerca has provided paleontologists with a rich fossil record of the earliest human beings in Europe. The findings have revealed priceless information about the appearance and way of life of our human ancestors, from almost one million years ago to the present day.

Located in ancient limestone caverns near Burgos, the discovery was fortuitously made when a railway cutting was driven through the site in the late 1890s. Several sites were subsequently excavated, but it was not until 1976 that the significance of Atapuerca was fully realized when a student discovered a human jawbone. Early human remains ranged from Homo erectus to Homo antecessor. Excavation work began in earnest, and the Sima de los Huesos (”Pit of Bones”) staked its place on the paleontologist’s map. Located at the foot of a 42-foot- (13-meter-) high chimney reached by scrambling through the Cueva Mayor cave system, the fossils of bears, wolves, and lions had a minimum age of 350,000 years. Among them were remains of about 30 skeletons—the largest hominin collection in the world—of the human species Homo heidelbergensis, a direct ancestor of the Neanderthals. A second site, Gran Dolina, revealed layers of sediment rich with fossils and stone tools of the earliest hominins dated between 780,000 and 1,000,000 years ago.

On a more grisly note, the earliest evidence of cannibalism in the human fossil record was also found. It is believed individuals were consumed under what is termed gastronomic cannibalism—not in a famine or as part of a ritual. These hominins are thought to be part of the first wave of early humans to penetrate the rugged terrain and harsh climates of western Europe 800,000 years ago.

People usually don’t take kindly to commands and demands. For as long as people have been overpowering one another, there has been resistance to power. And for as long as states have been ruling one another, there have been wars of independence. Here is a list of six groups of people or individual states that have battled against controlling powers in their own wars of independence.

First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328)

When King Alexander III of Scotland died in 1286, his last heir following not long after, a feud erupted between the two leading contenders to fill the royal vacancy: Robert the Bruce and John de Balliol. In order to decide the rightful ruler, King Edward I of England was asked by the Guardians of Scotland to judge the contest. Edward voted for Balliol to take over but only after convincing the two prospective kings to swear fealty to England. King John de Balliol immediately regretted his oath to Edward when the English king demanded that he send troops to war against France. Balliol refused, and Edward punished the Scots by invading their country, beginning a 32-year war for Scottish independence. Scotland fought back against the English forces but to no avail at first. Balliol was imprisoned, and another man named William Wallace filled his void in years of resistance against English control. Eventually, Scotland asked France for assistance, angering Edward even further. But before he could subdue Scotland into a dutiful territory, Edward I died and left his son in charge of a divided England. With a now weakened opponent, Robert the Bruce rose again from his initial loss for kingship to finally secure Scottish independence at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.

Mexican War of Independence (1810–21)
In 1808 France invaded Spain in an attempt to take control of the Iberian peninsula. The subsequent war caused an uproar in Spain’s American colonies over neglect. The Spanish government, colonists believed, allowed injustice to the poor and discrimination against Native Americans and mestizos, or people of mixed ancestry. A Roman Catholic priest from the colony named Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla called for a revolt against Spain in his famous speech, the “Grito de Dolores.” Hidalgo’s speech was inspirational, and a rebellion swept the entire colony, eventually reaching the capital, Mexico City. But, for some unknown reason, Hidalgo retreated, and the rebellion ended in failure. For years afterward, revolution bubbled in small areas around New Spain. Opposition to the rebels came from American-born Spaniards, called “criollos,” who received amnesty from Spain for surrendering in the rebellion. The two warring factions of Mexican royalists and rebels left the colony at a stalemate. However, in 1820 Spain instituted a liberal government that lessened the role of the Catholic church and the royal nobility, which threatened the power of the royalist elites. In order to maintain their power and the status quo, royalist forces began to fight alongside the rebels, eventually securing the independence of Mexico on September 27, 1821","The First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328) arose from a dispute over the rightful ruler of Scotland after King Alexander III's death. It led to a 32-year war for Scottish independence, initially driven by King Edward I of England's interference in Scottish affairs. The conflict saw Scottish resistance, led by figures like William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, against English control. After Edward I's death and a divided England, Robert the Bruce secured Scottish independence at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.

The Mexican War of Independence (1810–1821) resulted from unrest in Spain's American colonies due to French invasion and perceived injustice. Miguel Hidalgo's call for revolt sparked a rebellion, but it initially failed. Over the years, smaller uprisings continued, with opposition from American-born Spaniards. The conflict eventually saw royalist forces aligning with rebels, leading to Mexico's independence on September 27, 1821, amid Spain's liberal government changes."

The French Revolution was hugely inspirational: if French commoners could overthrow their country’s oppressive government, why couldn’t other groups do the same? The slaves and citizens in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (now known as Haiti) wondered just that. Saint-Domingue’s slaves had no rights, and the citizens of the colony were angered by trade restrictions in which they had no say. Tensions rose between the colony and its unjust ruler, so the General Assembly of Paris attempted to ease this pressure by granting citizenship to free people of color, an unprecedented move by a colonial power. However, this angered the slave population further, who would then be citizens were they not slaves. A rebellion erupted in 1791, led by former slave Toussaint Louverture, and spread throughout the island and began the Haitian Revolution. To keep the territory under control, France made another bold move: it freed all the slaves in Saint-Domingue, calming tensions for a while. However, ideas of reinstating slavery grew, along with revolts against French control, when Napoleon Bonaparte took over at the helm of France. After years of fighting, the Haitian rebels defeated the last wave of French forces at the Battle of Vertières, and Haiti became the first black-led nation to establish its independence.

Under the control of the British East India Company in 1857, Indian people felt constrained and oppressed. Through various political tactics, British forces would often take control of land from Indian officials. One such trick, a doctrine of lapse, secured land for the British if a native ruler was “incompetent” or died without a male heir. Not only was Indian land stolen, but the culture was threatened as well. Christian missionaries often attempted to convert the largely Hindu and Muslim population. The breaking point came when Indian soldiers, called sepoys, were given bullets by British officials that required their casings to be bitten off. These bullets were greased with lard, and Indian troops believed that the grease could be either pig or cow fat. The use of cow fat goes against doctrines of Hinduism, while the use of pig fat opposes Islamic doctrine. Though the actual composition of the grease is unknown, the perceived insult spurred rebellions by Indian sepoys against their British officers. These rebellions, collectively known as the Sepoy Mutiny, are also referred to as the First Indian War of Independence by some. Mangal Pandey, an Indian soldier, was the first to revolt. The rebels seized the Indian territory of Delhi but were eventually quelled by the British. In response to the rebellion, the British East India Company was replaced with the British Raj, which had even more political and personal control over India.

Malagasy Uprising (1947–48)
In March 1947 the first political party to be formed in Madagascar, known as the Mouvement Démocratique de la Rénovation Malgache (Democratic Movement for Malagasy Renewal; MDRM), began staging attacks against French military occupation of the island. Since 1897 the island had been under the strict colonial rule of the French. When the MDRM tried to legally regain power in their country, the French forces denied their claim. In an attempt to regain their home and oust French officials, upward of one million Malagasy resistance fighters attacked sites of French control across the territory. Within months, French military forces were sent from neighboring African countries to push back against the rebellion for independence. Using mostly inhumane tactics, French forces destroyed the homes and villages of Malagasy people, committed mass executions, and tortured civilians and militants alike. It is estimated that up to 100,000 Malagasy people were killed by French retaliation to the uprising, while there were only about 550 French nationalist fatalities. Though they did not win their independence in the uprising of 1947, the Malagasy people were given control of their country and independence by vote in 1960","The Haitian Revolution (1791–1804) was sparked by the French Revolution, leading to a revolt in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti) as slaves and citizens sought independence from oppressive rule and trade restrictions. Led by Toussaint Louverture, the rebellion spread, and despite initial French concessions like the emancipation of slaves, renewed attempts to reinstate slavery prompted years of conflict. Ultimately, the Haitian rebels achieved victory over the French at the Battle of Vertières, making Haiti the first black-led independent nation.

"It’s time for Britannica—OK, one editor at Britannica—to jump into the perpetually unresolved “greatest ever in [insert sport here]” fray. We’re not technically a sports website, but this editor (hi!) has been obsessively watching sports for nearly three decades and arguing about them with friends for nearly as long. This list is, naturally, incredibly subjective, and shouldn’t be taken too seriously. Unless you agree with me, in which case this was the most meaningful thing I’ve ever written.

This list was originally published in April 2014. LeBron James overtook Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA’s leading scorer in February 2023.

(Read James Naismith's 1929 Britannica essay on his invention of basketball.)

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
What? The leading scorer in National Basketball Association (NBA) history is just the 10th-best player ever? Indeedy. While Kareem put up a whopping 38,387 points during his playing days, I can’t look past the fact that he spent a good chunk of his career receiving passes from Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson, the two greatest point guards of all time. Also, his career totals were inflated by the fact that he played roughly 10,000 years in the NBA. (Or 20. Whatever.) Nevertheless, he was an awesome force who dominated the sport for two decades and perfected the sky hook, one of the most gorgeous shots the game has ever seen. Plus, he was hilarious in Airplane! and fought Bruce Lee in Game of Death, so his cool quotient is easily the highest of anyone on this list.","In this subjective list of the ""greatest ever"" in sports, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, despite being the leading scorer in NBA history, is ranked as the 10th-best player. The editor acknowledges Kareem's impressive career statistics but points out that he benefited from playing alongside legendary point guards like Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson. Additionally, his extended career duration may have inflated his career totals. However, Kareem's dominance in the sport for two decades and his mastery of the sky hook shot are recognized, along with his iconic roles in films like ""Airplane!"" and his memorable fight with Bruce Lee in ""Game of Death,"" which contribute to his high cool factor on the list.
